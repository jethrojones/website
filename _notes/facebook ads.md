I started facebook ads on my [[secret newsletter]] yesterday. I got 71 people to click through and visit my newsletter signup page. 

No signups from that. 

But I have reached out to a few people and I now have 8 email subscribers. 

This morning I changed my targeting on my ads to focus on people who like things that mean they will probably like what I'm offering.
