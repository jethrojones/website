# An Overview of Prompt Engineering for Educators

Prompts are a powerful tool that can be used to teach AI how to do things. By providing a prompt, you are essentially telling AI what you want it to do. The more specific the prompt, the better AI will be able to understand what you are asking for.

For example, if you want AI to write a poem, you could provide a prompt like "Write a poem about the beauty of nature." AI would then use its knowledge of language and poetry to generate a poem that meets your specifications.

This document is a valuable resource for educators who want to use AI in their classrooms. It provides a variety of prompts that can be used to teach AI a variety of skills.

### The PASS Method

To use an AI tool effectively, you need to follow a systematic approach that aligns with your goals and audience needs. In this blog post, we'll show you how to interact with an AI tool using the PASS Method.

Prompt: What do you want it to create? The first step in using an AI tool is to decide what you want it to create. Do you want it to summarize an article, generate questions, or create a lesson plan? Defining your prompt will help you narrow down your options and find an AI tool that meets your needs. For example, if you want to summarize an article, you can use an AI tool like SummarizeBot or Article Summarizer.

Audience: Who is this for? The next step is to consider your audience. Who are you creating this for, and what do they need? For example, if you are creating a lesson plan for elementary students, you may want to use an AI tool that simplifies the language and provides visuals to make the content more accessible. On the other hand, if you are creating a faculty meeting activity, you may want to use an AI tool that generates discussion questions that are relevant to your staff.

Specific Instructions: What are the things that must be done? Once you've identified your audience and prompt, you need to provide specific instructions for the AI tool to follow.

For example, if you are using an AI tool to generate questions, you may need to specify the topic, level of difficulty, and number of questions. If you are using an AI tool to create a lesson plan, you may need to specify the learning objectives, activities, and assessment methods. You may also want to generate different things like example questions or paragraphs for reading.

Scope: How big is this project? Finally, you need to consider the scope of your project. Are you analyzing a YouTube video, a podcast, or an article? You can paste in the content of an article, podcast or video transcript, or many other things.

Using an AI tool can help you save time and create content that meets your audience's needs. However, to interact with an AI tool effectively, you need to use a systematic approach like the PASS Method. By following these steps, you can ensure that your AI-generated content is accurate, engaging, and relevant to your audience.

### Initiation, Functional Instruction, Data Input

Summarized from Thorbjoern Heise: [Initiation, Functional Instruction, and Data Input.](https://medium.com/@thorbjoern.heise/a-generic-framework-for-chatgpt-prompt-engineering-7097f6513a0b)

Initiation: This element instructs ChatGPT on how to behave. It establishes the context and tone for the generation, giving the model an understanding of the role it is expected to play. It can be from different points of view (“I am a banking professional. Answer my E-Mail:”) or contain additional data (“I wrote a program that allows to divide by 0. Give me a good name for the software.”).

Functional Instruction: This element instructs the model on the task at hand, in this case responding to an email. It can be imperative or a question.

Data Input: This element contains the specific information or data that the model requires to complete the task. In this case, the model is expected to respond to the email. This is the input that the model will use to generate the output based on the context and instructions provided.

## ChatGPT Prompts for Educators

ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can be used by educators in a variety of ways. Here are a few examples:

ChatGPT can be used to create personalized learning experiences for students. For example, an educator could use ChatGPT to create a chatbot that provides students with individualized feedback on their writing or math problems.

ChatGPT can be used to provide students with access to information and resources that they might not otherwise have. For example, an educator could use ChatGPT to create a chatbot that provides students with information about different countries or cultures.

ChatGPT can be used to engage students in active learning. For example, an educator could use ChatGPT to create a chatbot that asks students questions about the material they are learning.

ChatGPT can be used to assess student learning. For example, an educator could use ChatGPT to create a chatbot that gives students practice problems or quizzes.

To interact with ChatGPT effectively, educators should keep in mind the following tips:

Be clear and concise in your instructions to ChatGPT.

Use specific and relevant language when interacting with ChatGPT.

Be patient when interacting with ChatGPT. It may take some time for ChatGPT to understand your requests.

Be prepared to provide feedback to ChatGPT. This will help ChatGPT to improve its responses over time.

Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can be used by educators to create engaging and personalized learning experiences for their students.

## Changing Tone in ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a large language model that can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. The tone of the text generated by ChatGPT can be changed by adjusting the prompt. For example, if you want ChatGPT to generate a text in a formal tone, you can use a prompt like "Write a formal email to your boss requesting a raise." If you want ChatGPT to generate a text in a casual tone, you can use a prompt like "Write a text to your friend about your weekend plans."

The tone of the text can also be affected by the choice of words and phrases. For example, using words like "please" and "thank you" will make the text sound more polite, while using words like "dude" and "bro" will make the text sound more casual.

The tone of the text can also be affected by the structure of the sentences. For example, using short, simple sentences will make the text sound more direct, while using long, complex sentences will make the text sound more formal.

Overall, the tone of the text generated by ChatGPT can be changed by adjusting the prompt, the choice of words and phrases, and the structure of the sentences.

## Image Generation Unique Changes

Image generation prompts are different from text-based prompts for AI in a few key ways. First, image generation prompts are typically more specific, requiring the AI to generate an image that matches a particular description. Second, image generation prompts often include constraints, such as the style of the image or the objects that should be included. Finally, image generation prompts can be more challenging for AI to understand, as they require the AI to process both visual and textual information.

Here is an example of an image generation prompt:

"Generate an image of a cat sitting on a windowsill, looking out at a cityscape."

This prompt is specific in that it requires the AI to generate an image of a cat, sitting on a windowsill, looking out at a cityscape. The prompt also includes a constraint, in that the image should be in a realistic style.

Here is an example of a text-based prompt:

"Write a story about a cat who lives in a city."

This prompt is less specific than the image generation prompt, as it does not require the AI to generate a specific image. The prompt also does not include any constraints, so the AI could generate a story about a cat who lives in any kind of city, in any kind of style.

Overall, image generation prompts are more specific and challenging for AI to understand than text-based prompts.
