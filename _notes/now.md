# Creating

With the successful launch of my last two books, [SchoolX][0] and [How to be a Transformative Principal][1], I'm writing my third book: Bad Advice for New Principals, which should be out...whenever I finish it. 

I've also started a [Big Impact Mixer](https://bigimpactmixer.com) where each month I gather people who are making a big impact. 

The [BE Podcast Network][2] now has 43 shows! Wow. 

This fall, we are doing a focus on [Literacy](https://literacy.bepodcast.network) with [Reading Is Fundamental](https://rif.org)

I'm currently working on a [Doctorate in Servant Leadership, Citizenship, and Character](https://publish.obsidian.md/jethro/edd_home) at [UMSL](https://umsl.edu)

# Coaching

Focus areas: Principal Leadership, through the [Transformative Mastermind][4], [Mental Fitness Coaching][5], and speaking [[speaking|schools to be more student driven learning]].

# Clarifying

This year, I've been doing a lot of speaking, webinars, podcasts, and more about AI. There's so much! It's crazy. I'm really enjoying it and I'm happy to chat with you about your needs around AI. 

If you're a school principal, I've made an invaluable resource with [AILeader.info][7] where you can learn about AI tools specifically for school leaders in just 3 minutes! 

You can also check out my [Principal Turbo ChatGPT Bot][8] and customize ChatGPT for you and your school.

Just launched: [edune.ws][9] - surfacing and sharing the best k12 news & content out there. Join and start getting smarter today!

I'm working with several companies in some way, shape or form on these topics: 
[SchoolAI](https://schoolai.com)
[Drip7](https://drip7.com)
[Lebra](https://Lebrahq.com)
[iStar Strategic Instruction Model Federally Funded Grant](https://sim.ku.edu/sim-reading-programs)
