# Creating

With the successful launch of my last two books, [SchoolX][0] and [How to be a Transformative Principal][1], I'm writing my third book: Bad Advice for New Principals, which should be out...whenever I finish it. 

The [BE Podcast Network][2] now has 43 shows! Wow. 

This fall, we are doing a focus on [Literacy](https://literacy.bepodcast.network) with [Reading Is Fundamental](https://rif.org)

I'm currently working on a [Doctorate in Servant Leadership, Citizenship, and Character](https://publish.obsidian.md/jethro/edd_home) at [UMSL](https://umsl.edu)

# Coaching

Focus areas: Principal Leadership, through the [Transformative Mastermind][4], [Mental Fitness Coaching][5], and speaking [schools to be more student driven learning][6]. 

I am also the fractional Executive Director of [Inland Northwest Cybersecurity Hub (Inch360)][13], a non profit focused on supporting cybersecurity in the Inland Northwest.

# Clarifying
## A Decade Never to be Forgotten
I just started a project that will help us all get closer to Christ. 

The Best time to start a ten year journal is a decade ago. 

The second best time to start a ten year [journal is today][12].

There's also a [podcast](https://adecadenevertobeforgotten.com) following the stories of 12 awesome people over the next decade. 

## AI
This year, I've been doing a lot of speaking, webinars, podcasts, and more about AI. There's so much! It's crazy. I'm really enjoying it and I'm happy to chat with you about your needs around AI. 

If you're a school principal, I've made an invaluable resource with [AILeader.info][7] where you can learn about AI tools specifically for school leaders in just 3 minutes! 

You can also check out my [Principal Turbo ChatGPT Bot][8] and customize ChatGPT for you and your school.

I'm working with several companies in some way, shape or form on these topics: 
- [SchoolAI](https://schoolai.com)
- [Drip7](https://drip7.com)
- [Lebra](https://Lebrahq.com)
- [iStar Strategic Instruction Model Federally Funded Grant](https://sim.ku.edu/sim-reading-programs)
