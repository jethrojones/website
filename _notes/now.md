# Creating


I've launched a new podcast called [A Decade Never to Be Forgotten](https://adecadenevertobeforgotten.com) - this podcast follows twelve people over ten years on their spiritual journey to be closer to Christ. There is also a [community][12].

With the successful launch of my last two books, [SchoolX][0] and [How to be a Transformative Principal][1], I'm writing my third book: Bad Advice for New Principals, which should be out...whenever I finish it. 

The [BE Podcast Network][2] now has 50 shows! Wow. 

Last fall, we did a focus on [Literacy](https://literacy.bepodcast.network) with [Reading Is Fundamental](https://rif.org)

I'm currently working on a [Doctorate in Servant Leadership, Citizenship, and Character](https://drjethro.com) at [UMSL](https://umsl.edu). I even created a sweet new web site to track it all at drjethro.com

# Coaching

Focus areas: Principal Leadership, through the [Transformative Mastermind][4], [Mental Fitness Coaching][5], and speaking [schools to be more student driven learning][6]. 

I've started mentoring leaders through [LinkedLeaders](https://linkedleaders.com) which is a great platform for just-in-time mentoring support.

# Clarifying

## AI
This year, I've been doing a lot of [[speaking]], webinars, podcasts, and more about AI. There's so much! It's crazy. I'm really enjoying it and I'm happy to chat with you about your needs around AI. 

If you're a school principal, I've made an invaluable resource with [AILeader.info][7] where you can learn about AI tools specifically for school leaders in just 3 minutes! 

You can also check out my [Principal Turbo ChatGPT Bot][8] and customize ChatGPT for you and your school.

I'm working with several companies in some way, shape or form on these topics: 
- [SchoolAI](https://schoolai.com)
- [Drip7](https://drip7.com)
- [Lebra](https://Lebrahq.com)
- [iStar Strategic Instruction Model Federally Funded Grant](https://sim.ku.edu/sim-reading-programs)
