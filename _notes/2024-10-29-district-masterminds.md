Superintendents want their principals to be successful, but they don't always know how to help them. And, try as we might, sometimes, it is just really hard to reveal your weaknesses to your supervisor.

Principals need someone they can talk with on a regular basis to help them get better, one step at a time. They need someone who cares only about their success, not some other motive. They need someone who is not politically connected to their work, so they can have an objective view of the struggles the principals are facing.

This is the exact role that I fulfill through the Transformative Mastermind. Principals choosing to be part of this program on their own have been successful at meeting district goals, overcoming challenges, and improving academic outcomes for their students.


Imagine your whole district leadership working on a weekly basis to improve incrementally.

The Transformative Mastermind Experience:

*Weekly 1-hour long group coaching sessions (principals either join established groups with principals from around the world, or attend at a specific time designated for your district)


*Monthly book studies on a leadership-focused book


*Additional ad-hoc coaching with Jethro as needed


*Early release podcast episodes from Transformative Principal


*Ideal week productivity course


*Private facebook and voxer communities for additional sharing outside the mastermind time.
