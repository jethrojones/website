This year, we are starting a new tradition. 

We're calling it Fast Sunday Family Feast. 

Each month, we fast as a family. We skip two meals, (essentially 24 hours) and then donate money to our church to distribute to families in need. 

There is a deep [spiritual component](https://jethro.site/2023/10/09/the-value-of-spiritual-learning/) to this as well. We fast for guidance, support, and miracles. Not only do we believe they happen, we actually get to see it. 

Part of what we have focused on with fasting as a family has been around all kinds of things, especially deeply spiritual things. 

We believe that depriving ourselves of food is one way we can show our devotion to God and ask Him to work miracles in our lives. 

By the end of the 24 hours (or so) everybody is understandably hungry. And we want food! 

But I wanted to do something else that would bring us a bit closer to each other and help us externalize our thoughts to other people. 

So we decided to start this Fast Sunday Family Feast. 

We're going to still fast, but to finish off our fast, and eat our big meal, we're going to also make food from other cultures that we can learn about and celebrate. 

Food brings people together in every culture. 

And while food has certainly been a problem for me, as far as weight gain goes, I really love making and eating food, and I want to have a healthy relationship with it. 

Doing this Fast Sunday Family Feast, I hope, will bring us closer to each other, help us learn about other cultures, and make our fast more meaningful as well.
