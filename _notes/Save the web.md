> Today, we’re introducing [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) a new extension that helps you highlight and capture the web in your favorite browser. Anything you save is stored as durable Markdown files that you can read offline, and preserve for the long term.

> Web Clipper makes it easy to shape Obsidian into a recipe book, a personal movie database, a travel planner, or read-it-later inbox. It turns your favorite browser into a sharper tool.

I used to do link-list style blog posts, but it was always so tedious to do. This new process should help tremendously.
