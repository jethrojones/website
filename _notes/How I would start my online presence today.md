How should I get started with a web site today? 

I get asked this question more often than I care to admit. If it is free, it's probably not going to have what you need, and when you pay for services, you pay attention to them as well. 

I would also direct you to my [[2024-10-04-tools|tools]] page for all the tools I use. 

Lots of people use Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress, and more. 

If you just need one page, you need to use [Carrd.co](https://try.carrd.co/2hzyxwr8)

Most of those are too expensive and too complex for what people need who just need a website to show they aren't crazy! 

Here are the things you need to know:

## Domain Names
If you want to exist online, you want to have a domain name. jethro.site is this web site. I have about 50 of these. 

All a domain name says is "this is where to find me online." 

Then you need to connect a web site to that domain. 

https://sdl.academy is a domain name I own, which I recently learned is not directed to any web site, so it just sits out there. (If you're reading this in the future, it will be corrected and direct you to a page on this site.)

## Web Host
This is where you create and edit the content for your web site. While I'm striving to a place of [Tech Independence](https://sive.rs/ti), that's probably not the right thing for everyone, so I won't push that on you. 

This is the company you pay to keep your stuff out there. 

Since most people who ask me this question are non-technical, I'm going to steer clear of the technical solutions, and point to those that are easy and inexpensive. 

### Static vs. Dynamic
I define a static web site as a site that you are not going to update much and that you have there to make it easy to point people to something. A great failed business idea of mine that got far, but not far enough is a static site, designed as a reminder of the lessons I learned about that project. All it has is a YouTube video embedded.
