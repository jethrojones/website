I was quoted in a story about a book controversy in IL. [Good article, check it out](https://roscoenews.com/g/roscoe-il/n/275174/book-fair-controversy-prairie-hill-sparks-community-debate-over-book-selection). 

Education experts agree that better communication and structured processes could help alleviate some of these concerns.

[Jethro Jones](https://www.jethrojones.com/), a Transformative Principal in Spokane, Washington, and author of SchoolX highlighted the importance of involving parents early on:

> “Part of the reason why parents are upset about sensitive subjects in school libraries and book fairs is because they feel like it’s being snuck in. Notifying parents ahead of time and partnering with them is a great way to diffuse the situation. Send them notes ahead of time saying there might be books they find questionable, and encouraging them to talk to their kids about why they aren’t appropriate for their family can ease the tension. Parents need to feel like schools are on their side, not undermining their parenting at every turn. Open proactive communication helps with that. Ultimately, it’s about getting our kids to read and find joy in that reading.”
