This month for our [[Big Impact Mixer]] we are going to looking at how to personalize at scale. How can you help people know they are one of a kind and getting things tailored to them. 

Last month I shared how I hired [someone](https://x.com/bradhussey) to help me do this, and we'll review what that looks like implemented today. 

I hope you'll join me!

We talked about setting up automations, even on the [free version of Kit](https://partners.kit.com/bim) you can do this. Here's a video showing how to set up an automatic sequence.
