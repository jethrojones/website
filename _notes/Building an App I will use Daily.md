I've been doing a lot of playing with AI over the last two years, but I ran into a problem that I really needed solved, and I got AI to do it. using @Replit Let me set the stage a bit.

In December of 2024, I posted about a project I started: [[A Decade Never to be Forgotten]].

This is a long-term, bold project spanning an entire decade into the future!

How could I make this vision come true in a way that will actually be attainable?

2 parts:
1. a podcast interviewing the same 12 people for the next 10 years.
2. a ten-year journal

I decided to use [Skool](https://skool.com) as the place to host the journal, but realized I have a small problem with how that system is set up. First, it needs new content every day to notify folks. If we use the same 366 questions, and we want to keep their answers grouped, it won't notify.

Basically, what I would do is post a new question every day for a year, and then "pin" the question again the next year. Great idea, and we've really been enjoying it.

But then, during Lent, I pre-posted all the questions, and then engagement tanked. People stopped answering because they didn't get a notification.

So, basically, what I need is a way to have people get a daily email notifying them of the opportunity to post, and then a place where they can post. Skool, unfortunately is not built to do this.

So I turned to my usual favorite tool, [basecamp](https://basecamp.com) because they have a tool to ask recurring questions, but they can only be repeated monthly, and I need these questions answered every year.

Finally, I decided to use [Replit](https://replit.com/refer/jethrojones) to build exactly what I needed, and BOOM, after 5 hours of vibe-coding and planning and prepping and refining (and $13), I have an actual web app, deployed to my site, and running: https://adntbf.com

This is pretty cool, but it's not perfect yet, but the fact that I, with such limited knowledge get an idea from my head to a web site is a big deal.

I made this post into a video using [Descript's New Avatar Feature](https://get.descript.com/swu3aooczakr). Yes, it is a woman avatar and a woman voice, but I make plenty of stuff with my voice, so I thought I'd try something new.
