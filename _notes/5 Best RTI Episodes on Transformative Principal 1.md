I've recorded over 600 episodes of my podcast. Probably a hundred of those have been about RTI or MTSS. 

Here are the top 5 episodes about RTI from Transformative Principal: 

1. Episode 100 - [How we did RTI at Kodiak Middle School](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s3/100): https://transformativeprincipal.org/s3/100 In this episode we talk all about how we did RTI Scheduling at KMS. It includes our tutorial system which was a precursor to the Synergy system created later in the next episode.
2. [The Four Step process to School Change](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s6/253): https://transformativeprincipal.org/s6/253 In this episode I talk about how to make real change happen fast at your school, and it builds off of episode 100, shared above, and includes information about Synergy. 
3. [Making a teacher Data Dashboard](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s12/588): https://transformativeprincipal.org/s12/588 This one just shot to the top of my list even though it has only been out for a few weeks. It's because Rick has done an amazing job creating a data dashboard for teachers. We spend so much time and energy on data that we never look at! Rick shows us how to see it daily! 
4. [PLCs and RTI](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s1/32): https://transformativeprincipal.org/s1/32 - This is an oldie but a goodie, but it is formative in helping us understand how we combine both those systems for success. 
5. [Time Serving Students](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s3/119): https://transformativeprincipal.org/s3/119 In this episode, Jon Laffoon and I talk about how he thinks about time differently to make it about serving students, rather than students serving time. You can change how you think about time and therefore change how your school works.
