There are a few design elements where [[people ruin the internet]]. 

Recipes are one of them. 

Popups - subscribe to my food blog! 

SEO destroyed narratives that never get to the recipe. "I wondered, How do I make no bake cookies. Well let me tell you a 1500 word story about the one time I was 7 and they didn't turn out, and now I make them perfectly because I have tried 17 different recipes to find that one that was just like my grandma's secret recipe but I'm sharing for you here!"

And then the recipe is all the way at the bottom, with ads in between every other ingredient. Oh, and another pop up! 

So I use a recipe app called [Crouton](https://crouton.app), and it has several amazing features. 

I love how it imports recipes from images, the web, your camera, and any way you can imagine. Awesome. 

It's beautiful, and creates lovely, easy-to-follow recipes. 

You can control it with your eye blink on your iPad! 

And it makes sharing easy. 

In all the recipes for [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]], I put them in Crouton, unless my wife prints them out first!
