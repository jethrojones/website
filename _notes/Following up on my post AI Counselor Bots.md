Mike wrote to me and offered this perspective: 

> Personally speaking, college wasn't even on my radar until my high school counselor planted the seed in my head that it was possible and that there were government grants available to help financially. College and Careers weren't talked about in my home.. ever, so why would I have ever proactively asked for help, it wasn't in my world view.. literally. On the contrary, my kids never thought college and pursuing a career was not an option. Family should be the source that we can safely rely on, but it's often what happens outside of the family that break cycles of poverty and create new opportunities for kids within those cycles. In both cases, it was the human experience and relationships with the trusted adults that inspired the desire for something beyond high school. 

Let’s highlight that again, “It was the human experience and relationships with trusted adults that inspired the idea for something besides high school.” That’s the key here. Imagine if Mike had 10 personal advisors he could turn to.
