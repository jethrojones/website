I'm adding a new tool to my [[best ai tools]] list. 

From 2006-2008 I was in a Masters program with a 40 minute commute each way to school, and a 40 minute commute to work. 

I had to read a lot. But I didn't have time since I was spending so much time in the car. 

To figure out a way to get my readings done, I used an app called Ghostreader to have it read to me with terrible auto-generated voices. It was a slog, but I made it through. 

I've been anxiously waiting for these amazing AI voices to come to an app like GhostReader, which sadly [no longer exists](https://www.convenienceware.com/ghostreader). But I think I found the next best thing, called Listen Later.

> Email us an article, and our AI will deliver human-like narration directly to your podcast app.

To be honest, I usually use Readwise for this because it allows me to take and sync my notes to my Obsidian vault, which is essential, especially for work- and school-related readings. And it can also read them to me with nice AI voices, too. 

But I see a benefit from the convenience of having something else that will take it directly to my podcast app with a nice voice. 

It's worth it to try it out, because I think you start with $2 in free credits, which for me was 4 articles and about 35 minutes. Not bad. 

You can also choose from a few voices, I chose Nova for mine, but their default is a good choice. 

You can also add outtro music so you know when an article is over. Definitely worth adding that, otherwise it ends abruptly! 

I think I'll try this out a bit more for extra readings of my doctoral work this semester.
