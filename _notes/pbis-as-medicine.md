​

Our district recently hosted Dr. Terry Scott from the University of Louisville who spoke to us about PBIS. I've heard him a couple times and his description of PBIS as if it were used like a medical treatment is superb. It makes a lot of sense. When it becomes a matter of life and death, it becomes a lot easier to see why we would do things. For many of our students who are disadvantaged from the get-go, it really can be a matter of life and death.

Since the first time I heard that analogy, I wanted to _see_ what he was talking about. So, I made this Keynote presentation (and exported it to PowerPoint, too).
