This month, we had Australian food. We had two salads: a beet salad and a mint cucumber salad. The salads were not as easy to find, as we are finding out for all these different countries. We have to really look hard for salads, probably because nobody likes them!

Then we enjoyed Savory Mince, which was pretty similar to my mom’s goulash when I was a kid. On the side of the mince was a non-yeast bread called Damper, which only has three ingredients!

Finally, we drank fruit punch, which was fruit cocktail mixed with lemonade and ginger ale, definitely the favorite of the kids!

Then, we followed it up with a delicious apple crumble, where the apples were cooked on the stovetop first, and then baked with a delicious crumble topping. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture of that one!

The [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]] continues to be one of our favorite family traditions. This year, we have taken to inviting friends over so we can share it with more people. 

This month, after filling our bellies, we played a fun trivia game called, “[I Should Have Known That.](https://amzn.to/3KYspqf)” 

My daughters played this game this summer and fell in love, so we have enjoyed quizzing each other about things we should have known.
