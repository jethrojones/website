Tomorrow is the big day. 

[[Big Impact Mixer]] happens and it's so much fun. 

If you haven't been to one in a while, it's worth it to show up again. 

If you have been to one, tomorrow, here's what we are going to do: 

**Breakout Problem Solving**

What will this look like? We're going to spend 10 minutes receiving help with solving a problem, and 10 minutes helping someone else with a problem they have. 

Anything, big or small. 

I will create breakout rooms for two people. You'll have ten minutes to ask questions about your idea or process or whatever. 

Then, after you get coached, you'll switch, and coach someone else. 

If you show up, you'll get support and you'll be able to give support. 

We will take a few minutes before each breakout to make sure we line people up effectively. You'll put your concerns in the chat, arrange who you're going to meet with, and then go into those breakout rooms. 

You don't have to be an expert to be successful here. You can ask these questions: [[50 questions to ask to solve problems]].

People don't need expertise, they need a new set of eyes! 

Maybe you're writing a blog post and you want feedback. 

Maybe you're making a viral TikTok and you want to see how it performs and could be improved.

Maybe you're implementing a brand new solution that nobody has ever heard of and you want to see what this crazy new idea sounds like. 

The great part is that people who aren't connected to you can provide some major value that you didn't even realize they could provide. 

## How to prepare
Come with a problem you want to solve or an idea you have. 

You must be able to explain it in less than 60 seconds or you won't have time to get any feedback! 

If you want to join, shoot me an email or join my mailing list at [Big Impact Mixer](https://bigimpactmixer.com)

#### Who is this Jethro guy and why is he hosting this event? 

I have been podcasting since 2008, in various forms. 

Since then, I have created the longest running, most downloaded school leadership podcast out there, [Transformative Principal](https://transformativeprincipal.org). 

I now help other people who are mission driven to create their own podcasts and connect with the right people in the right way to build powerful communities where people take action. 

If you want to talk about how a podcast can help you make a big impact, please connect.

## Update January 16, 2025

We had a really amazing Big Impact Mixer today.

We did micro-problem-solving where people engaged with a partner to help them figure out a solution to a problem

After that, we debriefed.

There were great insights, and ideas shared, but here's the kicker.

Aaron said he got help understanding vertical and horizontal markets.

His partner said, "I never said those words".

You know how sometimes you hear exactly what you need to hear, even if the person doesn't know what they're really saying?

That's exactly what this was.

Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

So glad these little moments can happen.

I hope you can join us for next monthâ€™s [[Big Impact Mixer]].

And, invite your friends!
