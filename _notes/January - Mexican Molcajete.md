For this month's [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]] we had mocajete! 

For the last several months, every time I go to a Mexican Restaurant, I try molcajete.

It's a Mexican stew in a mocajete lava rock bowl. It's just amazing. 

I've got to say, we nailed this recipe, even though we didn't get an actual molcajete bowl, we just made it in our cast iron skillet.
