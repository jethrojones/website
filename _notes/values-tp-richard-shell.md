> In this podcast episode, Richard Shell, a senior faculty member at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, discusses the importance of standing up for core values in the workplace and how this can impact one's career. He explains that people often struggle with doing what is right due to various rationalizations and incentives that prompt them to look the other way.
> Shell emphasizes that there is no such thing as a small conflict when it comes to values and that turning away from conflict becomes a habit. Instead, he encourages listeners to embrace virtue as a habit, following Aristotle's teachings and religious doctrines. He also provides tips on how to handle difficult conversations with superiors by understanding their pressures and motivations.

Richard Shell is a global thought leader and senior faculty member at one of the world’s leading business schools, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He serves as Chair of Wharton’s Legal Studies and Business Ethics Department, the largest department of its kind in the world. His forthcoming book, [_The Conscience Code: Lead with Your Values. Advance Your Career._](https://amzn.to/3k9wkku) addresses an increasingly urgent problem in today’s workplace: standing up for core values such as honesty, fairness, personal dignity, and justice when the pressure is on to look the other way.

*   Why do we struggle with doing what is right?
*   All kinds of rationalizations put you away from looking at the problem.
*   Incentives prompt us to look the other way.
*   Position of power or control enables you to look the other way.
*   People don’t see what’s in front of them because they’re paying attention to something else.
*   Inattention blindness
*   Seeing it vs. owning it.
*   What would a person of conscience do, who is a principal?
*   Observe and willing to own it.
*   When it comes to values, there’s no such thing as a small conflict.
*   turning away from conflict is a habit.
*   Virtue is a habit - Aristotle and major religions.
*   Don’t do evil just because you think it’s a little evil.
*   You can be the person who steps up
*   How to have difficult conversations with your superintendent
*   5 different kinds of pressures, peer, authority pressure, incentives, role, systemic PAIRS.
*   Name the pressure.
*   Find the why the superintendent is doing this.
*   What pressure are they under?
*   Who can I talk to that will give me insights into what they are experiencing?
*   Find their motivation.
*   I’m looking to find reasons where this is a great idea!
*   Create a role play
*   Calling someone crazy is a failure of imagination on your part.
*   Shouldn’t have the conversation alone with the superintendent.
*   What is it that is really driving this?
*   Framing your position and aligning it with underlying interests.
*   WHen strictly in conflict, move from collaboration to power. Become a pressure source that is more painful than what they are experiencing
*   Your values are only worth what you’re willing to pay for them!
*   Happiness is the feeling you feel when you are doing something you know you should be doing.
*   How to be a transformative principal? It’s easy to get wrapped up in your identity as a principal. Go back to the reason you’re doing the thing you’re doing and ask if you are a person of conscience.
