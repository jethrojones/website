I bought a cardstock tracking sheet and a pomodoro timer from [Minimal Desk Setups](https://shop.minimaldesksetups.com/products/weeks-habit-kit).

One of my [[experiments]] this year is to track things physically, on paper, instead of just digitally. 

Tracking things digitally is nice, but once something is digital it has the same value as everything else that is digital. It sits behind a pane of glass, which is amazing because that pane of glass can be anything, but it is no longer special. 

A physical piece of paper, a book, hand-written or printed words on a page have a different feel. 

Doing this allows me to use my favorite fountain pen, and gives these things a sense of permanence. 

In January, I tracked these Habits (#days completed)

- Daily note to my wife (31)
- plan the next day (24)
- cold plunge (18)
- scripture text to my family (30)
- Podcast consumption >50% spiritual (10)
- [[networking experiment]] (3)
- Accomplish my big 3 (2)
- Newsletter 1x a week (2)
- [[coach|PQ]] in the morning (12)

For February, I'm changing it up a little 
- Scripture text
- cold plunge
- note to my wife
- podcast consumption >50% spiritual
- Accomplish Big 3
- networking
- plan tomorrow

## Plan tomorrow
Each day, I write the Big 3 that I want to accomplish. These are the three most important things for me to accomplish each day. That's part of my end-of-day routine. I'm still struggling, but it's good to make a plan. 

Sometimes, those plans get derailed, but I often can fit in the big 3 and then do something else.
