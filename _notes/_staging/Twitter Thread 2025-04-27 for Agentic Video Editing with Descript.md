If you're tired of spending hours on video edits, @DescriptApp Agentic Editing is a game-changer. Imagine a tool that anticipates your needs, automates complex tasks, and even knows when it can't do what you need it to. Editing a video podcast in 5 real time minutes!

This new Agentic Editing on Descript was announced this week, and I'm stoked I got to dig into already! Keep in mind, I'm playing with this on the first week out! It's still very beta and I get that.

Let me tell you what it rocks at, from the very beginning:

It did multicam for me just by me telling it to

It got titles, screens and everything set up correctly on the first try.

It used a layout pack that Descript has automatically loaded, and it looks great.

It made transitions that look nice and pretty. 

It knows itself.

There were a few times where the agent didn't do what I asked it to, and it knew it didn't, and it gave me clear steps of what to do next to do it manually.

It even pulled my guest's name and title from the transcript and added it to her introduction screen. 

 I learned some things that I didn't know before, which is always good.

Where Descript's Agent isn't great: It's not yet great at additional directions. Multiple times I got a "There was a technical issue. Would you like me to give you step-by-step directions to do that manually?"

It responded with: "Currently, my direct editing capabilities are limited to text, scenes, layouts, and some visual properties, but not to advanced video color correction (like exposure, contrast, or temperature) on individual video layers. That’s why I provided the step-by-step instructions for you to apply those adjustments in Descript’s interface."

If it doesn't know what to do, it searches help and gives an answer based on that. It also provides links to help pages to make it easier to do what I need to.

Now, this podcast isn't completely edited, and certainly it took me longer to write this up than it did to make the edits here.

Here's the other thing I'm curious about, does the length of the video matter in how it makes the edits and content?
