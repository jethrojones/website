One of the things I love about the internet is the ability to see an idea seeded years ago and then make it happen. 

Matt Webb had the idea in 2012 to create a restaurant called "Lucky Meat" where a flip of a coin would determine which cow was slaughtered for food, and which was...well, just slaughtered:

> By the magic of [tapu](http://berglondon.com/talks/plastic/?slide=24) - or, to put it another way, the [Law of Association](http://www.fyicomminc.com/spirit/laws_of_magic.htm) from the laws of magic - the lucky meat will carry with it the luck of the animal. By eating the lucky meat, the eater too becomes lucky. Imagine yourself being presented with, and eating, lucky meat, knowing that the meat has somehow been chosen, somehow won the lottery and ended up on your plate!

Turns out, that actually happened, [with a little twist](https://ourcowangus.com).

> We have pre-sold Angus as ==1200==== burgers ![](https://ourcowangus.com/img/small/burger.png)==  and ==4 handbags ![](https://ourcowangus.com/img/small/handbag.png)== which he will become in 452 days![^btw]

> If you own an Angus Token, you can cancel your pre-order in the [Remorse Portal](https://ourcowangus.com/portal#remorse) to potentially save Angus. Once 50% of token holders do this,==Angus will live.==
> [CANCEL PRE-ORDER](https://ourcowangus.com/portal#remorse)
> Don’t have a token, but still want to save Angus? [Buy one on StockX](http://stockx.com/MSCHF-Our-Cow-Angus-Burger-3-Pack-Token), then cancel its pre-order.

[MSCHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCHF#cite_note-9) "is an American art collective based in Brooklyn, New York," according to wikipedia. They do "drops" where they release something, often artistic-adjacent. You can see a full list [here](https://mschf.com). 

I first joined their list in September of 2020, with [CardVCard](https://cardvcard.com). Their projects are pretty interesting and unique, as the attempt with Angus above shows. 

Isn't it cool that someone can make something cool and unique and because of the Internet get it out there to the world? I love it. 

[^btw]: pretty cool that I copied that text and the images came with it from the web site.
