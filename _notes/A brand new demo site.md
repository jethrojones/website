While some [[people ruin the internet]]. Some people make [[Sites I drool over]]. 

For my [[Big Impact Mixer]], I use [buttondown](https://buttondown.com/refer/jethrojones) as a special email list that gets very limited emails. One reason I use that is that I want to have a lightweight mail service to send emails to this group. 

Second, I like to try new things and see how they work. 

Third, I'm preparing for something bigger in the future for my daughter, which I'm very excited about. If you're part of my [[Big Impact Mixer]], you'll hear about it, I'm sure.

Last year, Buttondown released a Demo Site: 
> A marketing site can be lovely and suggestive (have you noticed all of the nice refreshes we've done to ours lately?) but it pales in comparison to a bona fide demo: nothing gives a more honest sense of what a product does than a real-world example.

> So we've built a demo site for Buttondown, helpfully located at [demo.buttondown.com](https://demo.buttondown.com/). No signup required; just click around and see what you can do.

What I just *love* about this idea is that you don't have to be a paying member to see what the backend is like. 

I don't know how much effort or work that is but I love the idea and would incorporate that idea into any kind of software I made, if it were possible. I'm sure there are many situations where that just would not work, but it gives you a good idea of what's possible before you start using the service.
