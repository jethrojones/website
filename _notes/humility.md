## Why do we have weaknesses?
> And if men come unto me I will show unto them their [weakness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng#note27a). I [give](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng#note27b) unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my [grace](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng#note27c) is sufficient for all men that [humble](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng#note27d) themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make [weak](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng#note27e) things become strong unto them. - [Ether 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

This year, I have applied for over fifty jobs, and I have only been invited to one interview. It's incredibly humbling to be rejected so much, and yet, I feel blessed that somewhere down the line, this challenge will result in some sort of blessing. 

At the end of 2018-2019 school year, I was moved out of my school for unfair reasons. I was really upset. I was really depressed. This was a huge challenge for me and very difficult to go through. But this weakness period in my life was actually a blessing and led to great success at coaching other principals who were also on the verge of being pushed out. Although it was hard, I am very grateful that I was able to go through this experience. 

I found some solace in this talk by [[loaves and fishes|Dallas Jenkins]]. 

I wrote about the need to be [strong you can be humble](https://jethro.site/2023/10/17/be-strong-so-you-can-be-humble/). 
## Beware of Pride
> Pride is a sin that can readily be seen in others but is rarely admitted in ourselves. Most of us consider pride to be a sin of those on the top, such as the rich and the learned, looking down at the rest of us. (See [2 Ne. 9:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.42?lang=eng#p42).) There is, however, a far more common ailment among us—and that is pride from the bottom looking up. It is manifest in so many ways, such as faultfinding, gossiping, backbiting, murmuring, living beyond our means, envying, coveting, withholding gratitude and praise that might lift another, and being unforgiving and jealous. - [President Ezra Taft Benson - Beware of Pride](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)
