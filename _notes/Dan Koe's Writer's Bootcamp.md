I'm committing to attending and documenting what I'm doing with Dan Koe's Writer's Bootcamp. 

Is this really going to be much different from the [[A Summary of my Ship30 Writings|Ship30 event]] I did last year? 

Yes. 

Why? 

Because I am going to document this process and dedicate this as part of my work day. 

I'm doing this course because I love to write and share my ideas, but the problem is nobody ever sees my writing! 

I refuse to believe that I don't actually have good ideas, because I know I do, because people have quoted me back to me enough that I know I can make an impact. 

Here's my challenge. Dan Koe is making money by teaching people how to make money on the internet. This is one of the ways [[people ruin the internet]].

So, why do I pay for this kind of stuff again and again? 

Well, because I like to learn, I like to surround myself with people who are also trying to do that. And I keep waiting/hoping for someone to reach me the way I want to be reached. 

Also, Dan's app [Kortex](kortex.co), looks cool, and he will obviously use it to teach this course. This will be a good way to learn it. 

Finally, Dan is talking about implementing "Zettlekasten". I have a lot of interests, and I want to be prolific in my writing, not just here on my blog, but also in journals, books, my dissertation, and more. 

What I'm currently doing social media is basically posting my podcast episodes. I have a TON of content there, and I need to find a way to use it more effectively and do something with it. 

A few stats: 

LinkedIn posts usually get about 50-100 impressions. 
X posts get about 50 views. 
My podcast gets about 500 downloads in the first seven days
instagram reels get less than 250 views usually
Instagram posts get less than 50 views

Because Instagram does it in a nice way, here's a screenshot from my account:
