Truth exists. And it's three dimensional.

<!--more-->

When we think we see truth, we likely only see a small sliver of it. Like looking at a sphere edge-on and seeing only a circle, or catching a shadow and mistaking it for the object itself.

> both truths—religious and scientific—exist in harmony.

> Truths found through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments and truths found through the diligent study of *His* scientific processes here on earth can combine into a beautiful blessing of knowledge that can enhance our lives, save our children, bless our earth, and help us return to our heavenly home with the blessings of exaltation.

Jamie Jensen argues that truths found through faith and truths found through study can combine into something greater than either alone. I think she's onto something deeper than just compatibility.

The real insight isn't that faith and science can coexist. It's that any single pathway to truth—whether religious, scientific, experiential, or intuitive—captures only a fraction of what's actually there. We're all feeling different parts of the elephant.

This should make us humble about what we think we know, and curious about perspectives that seem to contradict our own. That apparent contradiction might just be another face of the same multidimensional truth we're all trying to understand.
