One of the things I talk about often with people is that safety should not be the goal of schools. It's the cost of doing business. To frame safety as the goal is to shirk our responsibility for both safety and learning. 

Learning should be the priority, safety is the price we pay to be able to focus on learning. 

I like the way this company shares their stance on customer Safety:

> We adhere to all HIPAA privacy and security requirements. HIPAA is at the core of every decision we make, from how we design our interface to where your data is stored. We go beyond HIPAA compliance to maintain your clients' privacy. Don't believe us? Check out our [Trust Center](https://trust.sessionshealth.com/).

Their priority is giving therapists more time to focus on their clients:
> Focus on clients
> Become more productive
	Focus more on your clients and less on cleaning up a messy desk. Let Sessions Health do the heavy lifting so you can spend more time on what really matters - your clients.
