### Imagine…

  

Imagine hearing your governor announce a reopening plan and

**feeling confident that you’ve already solved the problem**

, and are

**prepared**

 for whatever he or she directs?

  

Imagine waking up on the

**first day of the new school year, totally confident that you’ve put together a plan**

 that everyone understands and knows what is going to happen?

  

Imagine having the ability to

**focus on the things that really matter**

 the most?

  

Principals who have gone through this workshop already have found that they are feeling calm and confident about the future.

  

One principal said,

“I have really appreciated focusing on what I can solve and not worrying about the other issues.”

  

**Instead of nervously waiting**

 for direction to come down from on high, principals in the workshop have been

**proactive and focused**

 on creating a plan for their families, not trying to figure out how to meet the demands of their boards or local government.

  

Next month, join me in the

**Schools Reopening Workshop.**

  

This workshop does things the right way because

**you’re not going to waste your time**

 on anything that you can’t control.

  

You’re going to

, regardless of what your local government or school district says.

  

Together,

**we are going to create a future-proof plan for reopening**

 that will instill

**confidence**

 in your

**families**

, your

**teachers**

, and, of course, your

**students**

.

  

**Nobody should feel like they are creating something in vain**

, and you’ll walk away with a proven plan that will work regardless of how we open back up.

  

Here’s what’s included:

  

**Workshops:**

 Four live workshop session with action. These aren’t webinars where someone is speaking at you the whole time. You’ll be creating and doing work the whole time.

  

**Homework:**

**Outcomes:**

Each workshop and homework assignment will help you create something tangible that serves as an artifact for your planning and growth.

  

**Peer Support:**

You’re not alone, even though it may feel like that sometimes. You’ll have the support of the whole group cheering you on and helping you refine your plan.

  

**Resources**

: I’ve collected a tons of information for you to use to help make your plan. Other state plans, articles and research about the precautions we should take when reopening, opinion pieces from doctors and other experts, publications from major associations like ASCD, and so much more

# Testimonials

  

The principals who participated in this already have had this to say:

  

>Thanks so much for this timely workshop. It has definitely given me an**edge**

and the**confidence**

in building a plan for my school. I have appreciated**collaborating with others**

and all the**resources**

you have shared to really help us make**informed decisions**

going into the year. - Barb Labotka - Principal in Illinois

  

>“I found this workshop series to be very beneficial to get me to break down the process of planning to its smaller parts. Reopening is a very daunting task, and this workshop got me to focus on the pieces, rather than the whole. Jethro does a great job of making the planning process much simpler.” - Bill Clouse - Principal in Wisconsin

  

>“As a teacher leader, I left Jethro Jones’ Reopening Schools Workshop with a big picture view on to start the 2020-2021 school year, a framework to address any school start situation, access to many resources, and a communication plan that inspires people to feel confident that learning will happen this year and that the needs of the students will be addressed. **WOW!**

 While other leaders are mired down in technical decisions of change like masks and temperature checks (which will be necessary considerations for schools that will, in all likelihood, change over time), I’m leaving this workshop with a workable vision and clear on focus three essentials which is going to be key for agile leadership during this upcoming school year.” Donna - Pennsylvania

  

Principal Catt. joined the June workshop and was nervous that she wouldn’t be ready to open in July for her summer program.

  

The activities in the workshop helped her focus on what she knew was right. She said, “It's been really

**helpful to have some structure**

 and thought time going into July. Something that is coming up for me as of late is that

**one grade-level team want to push along a little faster**

and more rigorously than the rest of the grade levels. I plan to

**emphasize with parents**

 that summer program will really be about

**SEL**

 and

**community building**

 (and not so much about getting in assignments and getting ahead of the August curriculum). I want to find a middle ground and I think, essentially, we are all saying the same thing but defining "curriculum" differently.”

  

The activities helped her clarify to herself and her team that the focus for school needed to be on

**SEL and community building**

, and not feel the pressure to “

**get a jump**

” on standards, but rather to

**set up the school for success long term**

.

  

The workshops gave her confidence to

**pursue a plan that would work regardless of the restrictions that were in place**

.

# FAQs

  

What if my district is asking for something else besides what you’re offering?

  

You’re probably going to run into that. Your district is likely making a plan for all schools. We are making a plan for YOUR school. We want your families to know this plan was designed for them specifically. It’s about more than just following the recommendations of someone else. It’s about making a plan for your community.

  

How will I know if the plan will work?

  

We go through a process that works to make sure your plan is one that your school community can sustain.

  

Are you going to provide solutions for every possible scenario?

  

While we can’t possibly plan for everything, we can create a plan that is ready for everything. The secret here is to manage what you control. There are things that are out of your hands, and you need to let some of those things go.

  

I’m not sure I have the time to attend four sessions!

  

Attending the sessions will be very beneficial because they are focused on helping you. That being said, they’ll be recorded, and we know life gets in the way sometimes, so you’ll be able to watch the recordings at a later date.

  

Will I be able to see other plans?

  

Yes! You’ll share your plans with others in the group, and they’ll share theirs with you. And, you will also get a collection of state and district plans for you to study and see what else people are thinking.
