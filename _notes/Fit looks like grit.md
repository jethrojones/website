I love this quote about "fit" and "grit" because it perfectly encapsulates so much of what I believe about [[learning]]: 

> As one researcher suggested to me: "When you get fit, it will look like grit." That is, if you help someone find a good fit, they are more likely to display the characteristics of gritâ€”like sticking with something-even if they didn't before. From the book "Range"  by David Epstein

When something clicks with someone, they see how it fits and why it's important to go deep and through the pain, frustration, and difficulty they are going to experience with anything that takes time.
