You've probably never heard of the people who have influenced my leadership the most: 

I owe a lot of the progress I've made to these people:

**Larry Lawrence**

Larry was the mission president when I lived in Siberia for two years. Of all the things he taught me, knowing how to listen to guidance of the Holy Ghost was the most important thing. He gave this [incredibly powerful talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/what-lack-i-yet?lang=eng).

**Tim Bishop**

Tim passed away from pancreatic cancer four years ago. Hagiography is a real thing, but Tim was never negative, even when he had every reason to be. He always gave people the benefit of the doubt, even when they didn't deserve it. When we're in person together ask me about him. I've got some powerful stories, too powerful to not be in same room. 

**Reuel Jones**

This is my dad. Don't tell my mom I'm mentioning my dad on Mother's Day! My dad was service oriented to the core. I remember Saturday mornings as a kid getting up way too early, and going to help someone move, volunteer at the orange grove or do something else to help someone. I always worked hard so I could get back in time to watch X-Men as the last Saturday morning cartoon. He worked hard because he loved people. 

These people have taught me so muchâ€”and, just like they did with me, I hope to pass along my own learnings to the next person.
