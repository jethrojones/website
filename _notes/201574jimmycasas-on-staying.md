[PASSION...PURPOSE...PRIDE: What Makes You Stay?](http://jimmycasas.blogspot.com/2015/05/what-makes-you-stay.html?m=1)

> Regardless of the number of times you are tested in your daily work as a school leader, I hope you take the time in these moments to focus on abundance and blessings rather scarcity and frustrations.Â  I want my thoughts below to serve as an encouraging word from someone who lives your life every day and who can empathize with the feelings you experience on a daily basis, whether they be feelings of joy, sorrow, gratification, stresses, or even doubt.

It is easy for those of us who are connected to see only te best sides of each other, but there is always struggle and doubt when you are a leader. I think the key is finding a way to deal with it in a healthy way.
