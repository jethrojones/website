Today was office hours for AI, which [I do every month](https://jethro.webinarninja.com/series-webinars/6143/register). Join me! 

Kathryn asked a great question about how to adjust her bell schedule using AI. 

This is the [ChatGPT Conversation about Polson Middle School](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/njjz0u88wvyv5osgh45b0/ChatGPT-Conversation-about-Polson-Middle-School.pdf?rlkey=usdddf8s8rmd99hwlzvnorl2e&dl=0)

And this is the finalized schedule we came up with for [[Polson Middle School]].

We took her schedules from [this page](https://www.madison.k12.ct.us/polson-middle-school/general-info/daily-schedules).
