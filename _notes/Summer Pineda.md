I'm not a mompreneur, but I learned a ton from this video with Moiret Miketa and Summer PIneda. 

Summer started her career in the mortgage industry 16 years ago-2008!

Living the good life may sound rosy, but it is not all fun and games. Questioning yourself is real and natural, and despite her success, Summer battles it regularly. She finds peace by focusing on the simple things: happy healthy family and knowing she is making the right choices.
