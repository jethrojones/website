These are the tools that are completely essential to me on a daily basis. There might be affiliate links here. 

[Convertkit](https://partners.kit.com/zwdugtptgpu9) for building and sending an email list. 

[Obsidian]() - This is my note-taking app. And the app where all the pages in this web site are created. Here's [an example of how it is powerful](https://jethro.site/%5B%5Bclippings%5D%5D/2021/03/23/copy-search-results-in-obsidian/). 

[Descript](https://get.descript.com/swu3aooczakr) - This is what I use for podcast editing, screencast recordings, and pretty much anything that uses spoken word. Incredibly powerful and so easy to use. 

[Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u28470920z) - I have several different email providers. Fastmail is one of them. I use 1Password as well, and Fastmail creates one-off emails through a tight integration with 1Password so I don't have to use the same email address for everything. Helpful with things like data breaches, which are all too common these days. Fastmail is inexpensive, and is highly customizable. 

[Hey Email](https://hey.com) - Hey is my daily driver for email. In fact, all my other email gets forwarded into this email. Then I can send from some of those other email addresses, but I like the way Hey is used so I keep coming back to it. 

[Mint Mobile](http://fbuy.me/r34At) Cell Phone Service - Again, inexpensive, can pay all year at once and it doesn't break the bank. Good service, even great [[How to Use Mint Mobile's Minternational Pass|International Service]]. 

[Carrd](https://try.carrd.co/2hzyxwr8) - This is my favorite service for one-off web sites. Sometimes, I have [an idea](https://bigimpactmixer.com) and I don't want or need to build a whole web site with multiple pages, I pretty much just need a landing page. 
- [RIF & BE Podcast Network Partnership](https://literacy.bepodcast.network/)
- [My Link-in-bio page](https://jethrojon.es)
- [An Open Source Software Project](https://pickr.org/)
- [A Landing Page for my mastermind program](https://transformativeprincipal.com/)
- [An easy link to my daughter's viral video from 18 years ago.](https://famouskatya.com). 
- And more. I have 17 active web sites in there. 

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/jethro20) - Anything that I want to read, I put in here. It syncs all my notes to Obsidian, and helps me remember the highlights through spaced repetition in the app. The Readwise Reader app is incredible. 

[AudioPen](https://audiopen.ai/?aff=neRMq) - This is one of my favorite AI tools. It takes my messy rambling thoughts and clarifies them for me in many different ways. I'm a talker, and sometimes it is easier to process through talking than writing, but I want both. Love this tool for that purpose. 

[SmarterQueue](https://smarterqueue.com/?afmc=14r) - This is a social media posting automation tool. I can post to all my social networks from one place, scheduled in advanced, and that keeps me out of the feed of doom! 

[Cal.com](https://cal.com) - I like this instead of calendly.com because it is free for single users and open source.
