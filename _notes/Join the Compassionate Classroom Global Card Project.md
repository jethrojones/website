Every once in a while, I come across something that makes me stop and think, *“Yes — this is what education is supposed to be about.”*  
The **Compassionate Classroom Global Card Project**, led by my friend **Naomi**, is one of those things.

It’s simple, heartfelt, and exactly what our world (and our schools) need more of right now.

## The Heart Behind It

Between lesson plans, behavior reports, and testing cycles, it’s easy to get caught up in the *doing* of school and lose sight of the *being*.  
This project brings that balance back.

From **November 1 to December 15, 2025**, classrooms across the U.S. and around the world will come together to exchange **handmade cards of kindness and hope**.  

Each card is more than paper and ink — it’s a message from one student to another that says, *“I see you. You matter. You’re part of something bigger.”*

## How It Works

1. **Create:** Your students make handmade cards filled with positive messages, cultural celebration, and encouragement.  
2. **Connect:** You’ll be paired with another classroom somewhere in the world.  
3. **Exchange:** Students mail their cards and receive new ones in return — sparking curiosity, empathy, and connection.

## Why I Love This

As educators, we talk a lot about social-emotional learning, empathy, and community.  
This project actually *does* it.

It’s tangible. It’s joyful.  
And it reminds kids (and us adults) that kindness doesn’t need to be complicated — it just needs to be intentional.

In a season when everything speeds up, this gives students a chance to slow down and connect in a meaningful way.

If you’re looking for something uplifting to bring to your students this holiday season, this is it.  
Let’s help our kids see that even small gestures — like a handwritten card — can have a global ripple effect.

Let’s make compassion contagious.
