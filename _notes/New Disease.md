I discovered a new disease, called novolibrochitat. It can affect anyone. It can even be contagious, depending on your personal makeup. 

It can be so hard to overcome, and thereâ€™s no cure. But thankfully, it is not life-threatening

Symptoms include an inability to sleep, hallucinations, sometimes irritability, and an immense sense of emptiness each time they overcome a bout of the disease. 

Doctors are clueless as to what causes it. They're clueless as to how to help. 

Novo meaning new. 
<!--more-->
Libro meaning book. 

Chitat meaning to read. 

It happens when a new book is released and instead of going to bed, you notice that you can get it on your Kindle at about 9pm the night before it is released, and then you stay up all night reading it because you were so excited it came out. 

My prayers are with anyone struggling with this terrible illness.
