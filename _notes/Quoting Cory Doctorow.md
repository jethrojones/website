I wrote about this in 2023: I will never again devote my energies to building up an audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to that audience at [will](https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/06/fool-me-twice-we-dont-get-fooled-again/)

Nearly 8 years ago, [I talked with Cory Doctorow](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s3/bonus114) and it was a highlight, for sure. 

The thing is, we cannot invest all this time and energy into a platform that can cut us off for any reason. 

I’ve felt the same way about Bluesky. I do have an account there, but I’m not building an audience. I’m not influential enough to think I’m doing that anywhere besides my podcasts, anyway. 

Funny how these same ideas keep coming up.
