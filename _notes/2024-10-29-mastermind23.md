When you prepared to be a school leader, did they tell you how lonely leadership is?

When you’re a school leader, there are few people to talk to about what you’re struggling with.

Do you ever feel overwhelmed with so many things on your plate that you never really know where to get started?

Your todo list is a hungry monster that is never satisfied.

Roel was brought into his school to give them a clear vision and get them back on track to where they knew they could be. But, with so many people and priorities pulling him in so many different situations, he could not focus on what was most important.

As a school principal myself, I have been there as well. It’s so challenging when so many stakeholders have different ideas of what should be the priority.

After joining the mastermind, Roel said, “One week, I was thinking I needed to focus on the budget because that’s what people said I needed to do, but through the mastermind I learned that I actually needed to establish my vision. Once I spent the time clarifying my vision for the school, the budget was much easier.”

Other principals don’t need clarity on their vision, and so their mastermind experience is focused on what they actually need.

Each person comes to the mastermind with a weekly goal and a group of positive peers that help her be accountable, so that whatever challenges she faces, she can succeed.

Here is how it works.


The Transformative Mastermind is a weekly 1-hour online meeting for principals to level up their leadership. It is the best professional development out there. You don’t have to leave your school. You just close your door for an hour. 

Each week, your principals will meet virtually with other principals from around the world (and me) and we all have one focus,help each other get better. 

In keeping with my student-driven learning model, this is designed to help each person, no matter where they are at. 

We set goals, read leadership books, and hold each other accountable. 

The agenda is as follows: 

Before the call: 

*Weekly email with book thought question, hot seat question set up

On-call agenda: 

*Check in


*Book thought question


*Hot seat (assigned the week before)


*Goals Review & Setting

Everything that is said on the call is confidential and treated with care. 

The mastermind helps you go from overworked, stressed, and on the path to burnout, to relaxed, engaged, and excited to go to work each day, knowing you are prepared to face whatever gets thrown at you!
