For this [[experiments|experiment]] I am going to do my weight training based on time to failure rather than max weights lifted. 

I'm not sure how many reps I'm doing of each, but the goal is to fatigue my muscles enough that they eventually fail, and that's when I move on. 

I've struggled with pushing to failure because I know I have more reps to do. When I get to failure, I'm done. 

A former NFL player that goes to my gym suggested this to me as a way to build muscle, get my heart rate up, and shed weight. We will see how it goes. 

I can take a break between exercises, but not during an exercise. If I stop for more than a second, I need to call that failure.
