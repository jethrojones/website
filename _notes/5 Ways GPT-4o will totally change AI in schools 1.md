Here are five wild examples: 
1. Real time Translation ([video](https://vimeo.com/945587808)) (another [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?si=2gCZdGZxZm_LJLMN&t=1348))
2. Real Tutor for each child ([video](https://vimeo.com/945587328))
3. Point and do Spanish ([video](https://vimeo.com/945587424))
4. Describing what the AI is seeing through the camera ([video](https://vimeo.com/945587840))
5. Being actual eyes for someone who can't see ([video](https://vimeo.com/945587840))

For a while now, you've been able to use ChatGPT with just your voice, and it has been quite impressive already. 

The biggest improvements are lower latency (which means your answers are faster) and increased performance around the AI speaking, hearing, and seeing. Those examples above are just scratching the surface. 

This is pretty incredible. We'll talk about what this means during two different office hours in the next twelve hours! 

The first AI Leader Office Hours will take place at 2 pm pacific [at this link](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/81828609436?pwd=bUVVMk9sdi9OUlhIUDVsZlBYb05ZZz09). 

The second AI Leader Office Hours will take place at 8 PM Pacific time. You can register for that [later one here](https://jethro.webinarninja.com/live-webinars/10570047/register) . This later office hours is at a later time to accommodate anyone who is in the APAC region of the world, Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, and any other locations in the eastern part of the world. 

I'll be joined by Nick Burnett, and this should be a lot of fun. 

We'll cover these new updates and what they mean for education and answer any questions you have about AI and workflows. 

A brief travel update: I'll be speaking in Arizona twice in June at the [**Arizona School Administator's Institute for Excellence**](https://www.viethconsulting.com/members/evr/reg_event.php?orgcode=AZSA&evid=44275183) and then the following week I'll be speaking at their [Summer Conference](https://www.viethconsulting.com/members/evr/reg_event.php?orgcode=AZSA&evid=43457665). Two weeks later I'll be speaking at the [Washington Summer Conference](https://awsp.org/professional-learning/training-conferences/awsp-wasa-summer-conference). If you're going to be at any of these summer events, come say hi! 

See you soon,
