This month for our [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]] we took it back to my mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to Russia! 

Pelmeni are small round dumplings filled with ground meat or potatoes, although, if they are filled with potatoes, they have a different name. 

Pelmeni was one of my favorite dishes while there. And it takes so long to make! It pretty much takes the whole family working together otherwise the process is just too long. 

But this is how they do it in Russia, also. They get a bunch of people around the table and then they make a whole bunch. Then, you freeze them on a cookie sheet (so they don't get stuck together) and you have pelmeni for days! 

Borscht is a delicious beet soup, and we also made heart shaped rolls. 

The nostalgia from this one is off the charts!
