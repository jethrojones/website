I want this site to be my forever home and the place to go to for anything about Jethro. 

I've always got my hands in a lot of pots, and I'd like a place for people to centrally go to figure out the best way to interact with me. 

A few criteria that I want this site to follow: 

## Fast
I want this site to load fast on any device. It should be seamless. 

## Simple
I want this site to be simple. It's about the words. If I can build something simple that I can keep up to date, then I can keep it going indefinitely. 

## Tinkering
I want a site that I can tinker just the right amount with. That helps me learn how to present myself better, and it helps me learn how to share what I'm doing better. 

## One-Stop Shop
Ultimately, I want this to be the one-stop shop for all things that I'm working on. 


## Some Sites I admire
### [Derek Sivers](Sivers.org)
Derek has been an inspiration for years. He recommends writing in all HTML, but I'm not quite there, myself. I prefer writing in Markdown and having it translated for me, because I like the idea of things being human readable, and while HTML isn't terrible, it's not as good as markdown. 
Derek's approach to [short URLs](https://sive.rs/su) and [tech independence](https://sive.rs/ti) are guideposts for me. 
### [Matt Webb - Interconnected.org](https://interconnected.org)
Fast, clean site, that has a long history. 

### [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net)
This is written in a dailies style. He has multiple posts per day, and he writes a lot about coding. I don't have that skill, but maybe I'll develop it some day.
