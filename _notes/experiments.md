One of my goals this year is to do experiments. 

I heard somewhere that the only difference between a crazy person and a scientist is that a scientist documents their experiments. Or something like that. 

My first one is trying [[Magic Mind]].

My second is [[high rep workouts]].

My third is [[paper tracking]].

My fourth is [[Dan Koe's Writer's Bootcamp]].
