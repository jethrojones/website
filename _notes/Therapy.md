> It's easy to read all of the above as cold or dismissive, but please don't. It's possible to share the same genuine care for people while disagreeing on the methods and the context that's due to serve them best. And it's also possible to look at the increase in therapy thinking, language, and methods in the workplace as an abject failure of modern corporate culture.

One of my big mistakes early on as a principal was thinking that we needed to be therapists in education. I got over that real quick, and all my [[Speaking|trauma-focused trainings]] quickly and explicitly state again and again that teachers are not therapists! Nor should they be. 

People need to learn [[Organic Skills]] and experience them outside of work.
