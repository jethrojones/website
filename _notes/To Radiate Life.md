> **T**he supreme prayer of my heart is not to be learned, rich, famous, powerful, or ‘good,' but simply to be radiant. I desire to radiate health, cheerfulness, calm courage, and good will. I wish to live without hate, whim, jealousy, envy, fear. I wish to be simple, honest, frank, natural, clean in mind and clean in body, unaffected – as ready to say ‘I do not know, if it be so, and to meet all men on an absolute equality – to face any obstacle and meet every difficulty unabashed and unafraid.

> **I** wish others to live their lives, too – up to their highest, fullest and best. To that end I pray that I may never meddle, interfere, dictate, give advice that is not wanted, or assist when my services are not needed. If I can help people, I'll do it by giving them a chance to help themselves; and if I can uplift or inspire, let it be by example, inference and suggestion, rather than by injunction and dictation. That is to say, I desire to be radiant – to radiate life – A Prayer
