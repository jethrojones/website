I have a few assumptions that are important to note before we start any serious discussions. 

Most people are good and have a [[desire to grow]]. Most people want to be their [[best selves]]. Most people seek after [[Truth]].

Despite those things, most people will [[choose the easy path]]. 

People are beautiful. 

People learn more when they are in charge of their learning

Most importantly, we are all children of God, and because of that, have inherited and been blessed with gifts, abilities, skills, and more. 

[[Learning is a lifelong process]]. It's malpractice to think of it just as the years of K-12 schooling. 

[Education](https://jethro.site/2023/09/25/education-is-the-responsibility-of-25a/)  is the responsibility of the family and the state steps in to support it. [[All parents want their kids to be successful]].

[All learning is spiritual](https://jethro.site/2023/10/09/the-value-of-spiritual-learning/).

All learning is personal.

Intuition (guidance by personal revelation) is real. [Justin Welsh on Intuition](https://x.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1881024584599654622?s=46)
