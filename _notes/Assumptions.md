I have a few assumptions that are important to note before we start any serious discussions. 

Most people are good and have a [[desire to grow]]. Most people want to be their [[best selves]]. Most people seek after [[Truth]].

Despite those things, most people will [[choose the easy path]]. 

People are beautiful. 

Most importantly, we are all children of God, and because of that, have inherited and been blessed with gifts, abilities, skills, and more. 

[[Learning is a lifelong process]]. It's malpractice to think of it just as the years of K-12 schooling. 

[All learning is spiritual](https://jethro.site/2023/10/09/the-value-of-spiritual-learning/).

All learning is personal.

Intuition (guidance by personal revelation) is real. [Justin Welsh on Intuition](https://x.com/thejustinwelsh/status/1881024584599654622?s=46)
