Middle school students came up with an idea, made plans, collaborated with the elementary school, worked with other teachers and a principal, and then taught volleyball, cheer, and soccer to 2nd and 3rd graders at a very highly proficient level.

This is the power of our [[Synergy]] program.

If adults would have organized all this, there is no way it would have been as successful.

I'm so impressed. Check the video below.
