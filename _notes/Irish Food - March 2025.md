Since March is the month of Ireland, we are eating Irish food today.

We have [colcannon](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/C5EA4BFD-EA28-4368-AF16-CD821773CBA0?locale=en) (mashed potatoes with kale), [Irish brown bread](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/B347A0F3-54C5-4B91-9700-720E5094E16C?locale=en), [fried cabbage](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/CE1C1B76-1B72-4FB0-A0BD-235794B1E7EE?locale=en), [corned beef](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/F72263C4-0B3B-4EEB-BF1E-2A4095558A4E?locale=en), and [Irish apple cake](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/104EB684-4970-4F6C-ABFF-12D221E0FDF1?locale=en). 

The corned beef is using the brisket from the cow we purchased last year. This is my first time using a brisket this way, and I’m sure it’s going to be delicious. It needed to brine for five days, so you know it’s going to be flavorful. We’ll make it on the traeger in a Dutch oven, and have it cook for about 4 hours. 

I’m pretty sure I mentioned this when I first talked about [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]], but the thing that I love about this is that it makes Fast Sunday more like a feast day. 

When I was a kid, and I heard about feast days while reading the Bible or learning about Jews, I always thought it was an awesome celebration of family and faith. We have been counseled to make Sunday a delight, and this is one small step towards doing that. 

Cooking new recipes forces you think about the experience. It forces you to be intentional. It forces you to plan. It forces you to work together. It forces you to try new things (and [[October - German Stuffed Paprika|sometimes fail]]). 

Our fast Sundays are more enjoyable because we are all working together. We are all playing a part and we are being more intentional. 

Here are some pictures of the cake:
