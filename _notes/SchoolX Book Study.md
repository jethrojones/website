No matter how hard you work, your school will always need more attention. 
> Every day, countless students and teachers miss out on their potential because the school environment isn’t meeting their needs. But it doesn’t have to be this way!

If we keep doing the same thing we've been doing, we're going to have more:
- Disengaged students
- Regular teacher absences
- You'll be constantly filling in for sub positions that don't get filled. 
### The SchoolX Book Study is designed to help you create an actionable, transformative experience in your school. 

Together, we’ll unpack proven strategies from SchoolX book to design a school that meets the unique needs of every student and educator.

## Here's what you'll get:
This isn't your superintendent's book study. 

We're going to dive into the book with an action plan. 

After learning the material, you'll actually make a plan for your school in these four phases:
You'll learn how to use the Design Thinking in your daily work as a principal:

You'll learn how to support your teachers without your saboteurs getting in the way of their success.

You'll learn how to support your students to be "enrolled" in school, not just engaged in the technology sitting in front of them.

Of course, we'll be talking about AI, too, but we're not talking about technology for technology's sake! We'll focus on creating an AI tool to help you speak in your own voice, to save you a ton of time as a leader. 

We are going to focus on the intersection of AI and Leadership, with a focus on leadership, and using AI as a tool to help us reach that level.

And you'll learn how to  *partner* with parents, so instead of worrying about which group is going to get upset next, you have an established and clear focus for committees, communities, and fundraising efforts. 

And here's the thing, it doesn't matter what kind of school you have, this book study will help you transform your school to meet the needs of the people that are actually there in front of you!

I want you to get a clear idea of what life can be like in the future if you start intentionally planning your
