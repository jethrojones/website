Imagine having a student who drives their own learning.

Imagine having your student's gifts and talents highlighted in their schooling, no matter what they are.

Imagine having a school experience that is tailored around your student, and your family.

SDL Academy is the personalized solution for your child's education.

We focus on and highlight your child's strengths, and use them as the basis for instruction.

Students are given real-world problems to tackle, while teachers follow behind and ensure that the standards kids should be learning are being measured and assessed.
