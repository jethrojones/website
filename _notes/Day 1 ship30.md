I've been waiting for this course to open for months. I missed the last one, and I was totally bummed. I joined Cole and Bush's Ship 30 for 30. Here are a few reasons why:

I've published over 1000 podcast interviews and I've learned so much that I want to share with others

Writing helps me articulate what is useful, not true (h/t to Derek Sivers)

I've predicted a lot of things, but since I didn't write them down, it doesn't matter if I was right!

Over the next 30 days, I plan on writing about Learning, Leadership, and Life.

Learning - All learning is spiritual, or if you don't like that term, all learning is personal to the learner. 

Leadership - We'll talk about leadership of self, leadership of others, and leadership of organizations.

Join me on this adventureâ€”and let me know if you have any questions along the way!

I'm excited to start sharing what I know online.
