I use [Descript](https://get.descript.com/swu3aooczakr) because it is the best out there. They're constantly making it better, too. I use it for anything where I have recorded audio or video. 

There are many other tools out there to transcribe or edit, but Descript has the best of both worlds. 

They have a tool called Underlord that allows you to "vibe edit" where you just give it directions and it does it for you. 

I'm adding some here to share with others and keep a record for myself. 

## Repurposing speaking clips
Here's the prompt for Underlord: 
> these are recordings from a presentation that I gave. I am Jethro Jones. Apply studio sound, and shorten  silences that are longer than 3 seonds. Add chapter markers, many of them, and  find the spots where I was speaking and make significant poignant points, and highlight them. Then write a X post and a linkedin post for each one, return these in a table. The posts should be written in a tone that matches the platform. 

I was using a rode wireless pro mic to capture my voice and it caught some audience participation as well. I ran this on two recordings, one that was just over an hour and one that was just under 4 hours! It wasn't perfect, but it did a pretty good job. What's really nice is that I can set that to work and do other tasks (like writing this up) while I'm waiting. 

I also remember where I said some worthwhile things and that's good, but this helps highlight things better and easier for repurposing.
