Here's the short version. Personal emails come from jethro@ and newsletter emails come from hello@

I'm using a new email address to send my newsletter. 

If you are one of the 3500 school leaders subscribed to my newsletter, you get emails from jethro at transformativeprincipal.com. 

If you are my friend, client, or otherwise, you get emails from jethro at transformativeprincipal.com. 

Well, since I've been using [Hey Email](https://hey.com), I've realized just how confusing that can be. You see, hey has a view for "the Feed" which is basically newsletters. The "Imbox" in Hey is for emails that I definitely don't want to miss. I want emails that are for me personally to end up in the Imbox, and newsletters to go in the Feed. 

The problem is that Hey can't/doesn't tell if you're sending me a personal email or if it is part of a newsletter. Hey filters between the Feed and Imbox by email address of the sender. 

So, what happens then is that newsletter emails I receive go to the same place as my personal emails. Some of the people with whom I regularly communicate use the same emails to send personal/work emails as they do to send newsletters. 

And until today, I did that too. But that ends now. 

I created a new email hello at transformativeprincipal.com to be my newsletter email. I set this up to be a "catchall" email address so if anybody emails that, and I reply, they'll get a personal reply from my jethro at transformativeprincipal.com email address. 

I'm guessing that there is probably nobody who reads my newsletter who cares about this as much as I do, nor do I think many of them will even notice! 

But, it's one of the things that annoys me, so I am excited to make this change.
