Many years ago, I was talking to my brother and he said something that really stuck with me. 

I was talking about a web development class I was taking in college (using [Macromedia's Dreamweaver MX](https://macromedia.fandom.com/wiki/Macromedia_Dreamweaver)!)

My brother, who sometimes could see the future, said, "You don't need to worry about learning that, because you won't need it, just like you don't need to how to work on your car."

Or something like that. I get involved in [[Move from BlogTalkRadio to Transistor|projects]] sometimes that make me realize that maybe I should know how to do this coding stuff. 

Other times, I think, if I could just explain it to someone else, they could do that for me. 

I've never really been very detail oriented, and I break things easily. And I don't mean that I break them in a good way. I often have no idea what is wrong. 

Those are not necessarily good qualities to have in a programmer. 

But then, I play with something like chatGPT and I can even connect it to my text editor and Terminal and I think, maybe I can do enough to get a proof of concept and then turn it over to someone more skilled.
