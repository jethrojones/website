Today for the [[Big Impact Mixer]] we are going to talk about your gifts. 

What gifts do you have and what do you bring to the table? 

We will work through some questions to reveal what our gifts are, and then we will talk about how to make those gifts manifest in our work. 

For example, I am a quick start. I can get started on a project and get it 90% of the way there, and then I can hand it off to someone who can do the rest of the work.  

I am also a gifted coach. The people I coach do better than I typically do at the same things. I believe that is because I inspire them and see the potential that they don’t see in themselves. 

You have many gifts. Let’s make them visible and apparent. 

There are many different types of tests you can take, but I’ll let you bring those or take those on your own time. We’re going to use a questioning framework to help us. 

See you in a few hours. 
10 am Pacific.
