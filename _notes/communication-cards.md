# Communication Cards
  
## Have you ever been nervous or anxious to approach your boss?


## Your employees have been nervous approaching you too!

The following cards are included:

* I have a storyline
* I made a mistake
* I need help solving a problem
* I need to vent
* I have a crisis in my personal life
* Itâ€™s all about the money
* I want to brag
