Two things I've learned from podcasting for over a decade: 
1. Every hates the sound of their voice
2. People suck at recording solo episodes. 

Here are three simple tips to get better on your next take of a solo episode without spending hours practicing!

1. Don't do it alone! 
Get on a zoom call and record yourself doing your solo episode to your friend/sibling/anyone you like. 
1. Tape a Picture! 
Literally tape a picture of your ideal audience member and speak directly to them. You can even include their name, and edit it out in post. 
1. Script or Outline?
It depends. Record yourself off of a script, and record yourself off of an outline, and do the one that feels most natural to you going forward. 

Implementing just one of these tips will help you record a better podcast, but combine them and you'll be a recording pro in no time. 

And, PS, only you hear your recorded voice differently. That's how you always sound and nobody cares! https://x.com/jethrojones/status/1795644307321618467
