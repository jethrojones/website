Miracles. 

Miracles. 

Miracles. 

This week is [[Big Impact Mixer]] week! 

ðŸ—“ Thursday, 10:00 AM Pacific

ðŸ”— Register to join us [here](https://bigimpactmixer.com).

Our topic is Miracles. 

We're going to talk about the miracles in your life that have led to you deciding to live your life this way and make your big impact. 

We're going to get in small groups, and each person will share their story. 

The challenge will be having enough time. We're not going to have enough time for everyone, but this conversation will be so inpsiring, you will want to have it again and again. Trust me. 

How do we tell a compelling story, sharing the miracles, but not make it so long that we run out of time for everyone else to tell their story? 

**How to Tell Your Story:**

Weâ€™ll use this simple framework:

1. **Event** (1 sentence): The momentâ€”the miracle itself.
2. **Backstory** (1 paragraph): Why this moment was meaningful.
3. **Action** (1 sentence): The step you took next (and maybe the next miracle it sparked).

Example:

- **Event**: I was removed from my school with just six weeks left in the year.
- **Backstory**: I had taken that job knowing it would be my last before consulting. I was afraid to step out on my own, but I knew it was soon time. I was still too afraid to do it, though, and I needed a push.
- **Action**: I turned to Christ to help me through the depression and began relying wholly on Him to make decisions going forward.

So, what we are going to do on Thursday, is tell a bunch of these little stories, taking turns after each one. 

There are a couple purposes to this: 

First, we have limited time to share our stories, we need to make it happen in a short amount of time.

Second, you always have a limited amount of time to make your point. This is an exercise in getting your story out in powerful snippets. 

There are a million little stories that go along with what I just shared. There's so much more to that story. 

But here's what I'm focusing on: A powerful story to communicate who I am, what miracles I've seen, and how that helps me achieve the bigger impacts that I am making. 

I hope that we will each be able to share multiple miracles we have experienced. 

Because I am sure that we have experienced multiple miracles. 

This is going to be fun.
