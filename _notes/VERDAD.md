> VERDAD tracks radio broadcasts from 48 different talk radio radio stations across the USA, **primarily in Spanish**. Audio from these stations is archived as MP3s, transcribed and then analyzed to identify potential examples of political misinformation.
> The result is “snippets” of audio accompanied by the trancript, an English translation, categories indicating the type of misinformation that may be present and an LLM-generated explanation of why that snippet was selected.
> These are then presented in an interface for human reviewers, who can listen directly to the audio in question, update the categories and add their own comments as well. (emphasis added)

Really fascinating walkthrough on [Simon's blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/7/project-verdad/). What I find so fascinating about this project is that it is capturing the *Spanish* audio. Not the English, but it's translating it and making the assertions in English as well. How cool is this? 

This has powerful implications, because you can share quotes:
