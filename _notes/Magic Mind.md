Magic Mind reached out to me about a sponsorship for my [[5 Best RTI Episodes on Transformative Principal|podcast]]. 

And, since one of my goals this year is to experiment and document, I’m going to keep a log of how it works and how I feel while taking it. 

## Day 1
That’s today, Tuesday, January 14, 2025. 

I took a shot, and had energy, seemed to be able to focus. Did some stats homework and I think I got it right on my first try, read 5 chapters in a book. 

Blood pressure at night was 145/108!

## Day 2
Woke up with a headache today. That was what I was most worried about. I don’t have caffeine very often and this has about 55 grams of caffeine. I was able to sleep just fine, but I did have weird dreams. 

Today, I had a harder time getting things done, but felt like I had energy all day, and I did have a podcast Interview that went well. 

Blood pressure was 131/101.

# Day 3
Woke up with a slight headache today. I did have weird dreams again. I’m noting my sleeping and waking because they also sent me some sleep supplements, so I’m going to take those in about 10 days and see how hey work when I use magic mind and when I don’t.
