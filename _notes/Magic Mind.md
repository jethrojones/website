[Magic Mind](https://www.magicmind.com/PRINCIPAL20) reached out to me about a sponsorship for my [[5 Best RTI Episodes on Transformative Principal|podcast]]. 

If after reading this, you think you want to try Magic Mind, you can use the code PRINCIPAL20 for a sweet discount, and I'll [[Delusional dreams of excess freedom|instantly become rich and famous]].

And, since one of my goals this year is to experiment and document, I’m going to keep a log of how it works and how I feel while taking it. 

## Day 1
That’s today, Tuesday, January 14, 2025. 

I took a shot, and had energy, seemed to be able to focus. Did some stats homework and I think I got it right on my first try, read 5 chapters in a book. 

Blood pressure at night was 145/108!

## Day 2
Woke up with a headache today. That was what I was most worried about. I don’t have caffeine very often and this has about 55 grams of caffeine. I was able to sleep just fine, but I did have weird dreams. 

Today, I had a harder time getting things done, but felt like I had energy all day, and I did have a podcast Interview that went well. 

Blood pressure was 131/101.

## Day 3
Woke up with a slight headache today. I did have weird dreams again. I’m noting my sleeping and waking because they also sent me some sleep supplements, so I’m going to take those in about 10 days and see how hey work when I use magic mind and when I don’t. 

Felt like I wanted to be productive today, and I was. Sometimes I get kind of lost in the day, but today felt like I had a bunch that I wanted to complete and I did that. 

I also had the [[Big Impact Mixer]] today, and it went well. I felt focused and on top of things. 

## Day 4
Most days, when my wife’s alarm goes off at 5 am, I’m up and ready to go, and sometimes I even wake before her alarm goes off. Getting out of bed has not been difficult for me for quite some time, but it has the last couple days. I’ve been getting out of bed at 5:30, which isn’t too bad, I’m sure, but it delays the rest of my [[morning routine]], and then everything feels off. 

Today, I again had a slight headache, but the headaches have gone away within a couple hours, and they aren’t bad. 

One thing that is nice is having energy, but not being jittery or anxious with that energy. 

## Day 5
Today was a little difficult because it was a Saturday, and I didn’t really need the energy. I probably won’t take it tomorrow. 

But no headache today. So, that’s positive. 
## Day 6
Day off today. 

## Day 7
Day off today for MLK, Jr. Day, so hanging with the kids. 

## Day 8
Back on the grind with a podcast episode first think in the morning, and then I had occasion to write a ton today! Over a thousand words in an hour. These are the notes I updated/wrote today: 
- [[Assumptions]]
- [[personal board of advisors]]
- [[experiments]]
- [[Nobody cares about our life as much as we do]]
- [[Students Need Human Relationships to Thrive. Why Bots May Stand in the Way]]
- [[All parents want their kids to be successful]]

What was so good about today was that I had a lot of thoughts that I've been procrastinating putting out there, but today I got it done. That's exciting. 

## Day 9
