My friend Miles did a social media fast around the time I was not logged in to social media. 

His whole article is worth a read, but this piece jived with my conclusion. I really hate algorithmic media, which is what most of our stuff is today:

> The truth is, most social media isn’t “social” these days. Derek Thompson just highlighted part of Meta’s FTC filing in one of their antitrust cases, where even they admit they aren’t “social media” companies anymore. They’re entertainment companies. Apparently, only 7% of the content the average consumer engages with on Instagram actually comes from “friends”, and on Facebook, it’s 17%. The bulk of the time is spent watching short-form videos from creators. If we all actually posted to our Instagram wall, it might still be a fun place to hang out. Instead, it’s TikTok. Bleh.

During my time off social media, I rediscovered a great app called [Tapestry](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6448078074) which lets you create your own actually social feed from RSS, mastodon, and other sources. It’s good, even though I haven’t found many great follows on the mastodon servers.
