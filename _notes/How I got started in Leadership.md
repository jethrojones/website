I wouldn't call myself an expert in Leadership.

However, I have spent 1000s of hours reading and learning about Leadership. And I have been in a leadership position pretty much since I was twelve years old!
## Here's how I first got interested in Leadership:

Twelve years old. In my church, we have lay leadership, even for the young men and young women. 

I was 12 years old and I was called to be the president of my young mens quorum. 

I thought, "This is great! Now everyone will do what I want. They will obey!" 

You can imagine how that went over. Like a lead balloon. Nobody cared that I was the leader. 

Nobody cared that I had that position. 

I learned very quickly that leadership is a different kind of work. But I had no idea what it was then!

Over the following 30 years, I've continued to be in official, non-official, lay, and volunteer leadership positions. 
## So my goal over the next 2 years is

to operationalize what I have learned about leadership and incorporate it into my doctoral dissertation. I don't know where it's going to end up, just like when I was 12
