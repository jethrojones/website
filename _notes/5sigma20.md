The 5Sigma Edu Conference is a place to learn with world-changing thinkers and innovators within the education community.

5 Sigma is a declaration of discovery. In science, it is used as a measure of confidence in a result. At Anastasis Academy, we are in a continual process of discovery. We call our education conference "5 Sigma" because that is what we hope for - declarations of discovery.

This keynote focused on the 5 stages of student driven learning. I shared stories of the work students have done at my schools over the last few years.
