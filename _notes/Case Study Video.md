I took an old episode, from 2014, which is still relevant to day, but has only had 8 downloads in the last 2 years on my podcast. It's an oldie, but obviously hard to find under 700 episodes. 

But it's still good! 

I used the transcript to create a case study about using social media for your school. 

Then, I took that case study and used [Descript](https://get.descript.com/swu3aooczakr)'s powerful AI movie generator to make it into a short, 140 second video about this school, which you can see above. 

Is this perfect? No. Does it get the point across and share good things that were happening at that school, and maybe help someone today?! Yes! Absolutely. 

And, I'm heading to Germany this summer, and would like to connect with principals over there. 

Therefore, I translated this into German and here it is:

Taking this a step further, principals can now use AI to make engaging videos based on content that already exists and turn it into shareable videos to inform, educate, and engage their constituents.
