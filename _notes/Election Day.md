{% if page.image %} <img src="{{ page.image }}" alt=""> {% endif %}Today is Election Day in the United States. I’m grateful to live in a free country where I can have my opinions and vote. 

My biggest concern today is that I can’t trust anyone about what is happening. 

The media has been shilling for Biden/Harris this whole time, distorting things about Trump, claiming he said things he didn’t say, when people could very easily go see exactly what he said. 

There was some furor over Washington Post not endorsing Harris, but I actually appreciate this crazy idea that reporters report the news and aren’t activists. 

I just can’t believe anything that is put out because organizations are so biased. 

That’s the most disappointing thing.
