I added: 
- Blog categories to the [sidebar in blog posts](https://jethro.site/mastermind/2020/03/26/how-we-set-goals-in-the-mastermind/) (I realize that many of my posts don't have blog categories!)
- I added [Inspirational Videos](https://jethro.site/categories/inspiration/) to start coming to this site from my large collection that has only been in an email list until now. This is my most popular page on my [other web site](https://www.jethrojones.com/inspirational-videos). It'll all be transferred over here eventually. It's actually [[inspirational-videos|already here]], just not ready for primetime yet.
- My workflow for inspirational videos is to find a video, add it to a Trello card, which then uses [[2024-10-04-tools|Zapier]] to make it into a text file, and then I use Hazel to move it over to my web site! Amazing. 
- I added a category Generator so that category pages are created and populated automatically. 
- I did all of this with [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/67513047-c9a4-800f-91ec-88087d2ac3aa) and [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/675142ff-1d58-800f-a81a-b2a78f6da60b) as my guide, helping me troubleshoot and figure out how to make it all work. 
- I did a ton of testing on my local machine, and then when I uploaded it to the web, it worked the first time! This is huge! I've broken this site so many times trying to make things work and botched it numerous times. 

I sure love [[learning]].

I am really enjoying building this site and it is so much fun. And because I enjoy it, I'm more likely to write on it and pay attention to getting things published.
