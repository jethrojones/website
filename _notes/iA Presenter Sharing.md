I love beautiful things, but I am not necessarily good at creating them. I love beauty when I see it, but I don't always do a great job at creating it. 

That's why I write this site in all plain text (see more at [[How this site is built]]).

I've also taken that approach with my slide decks as well. 

And there is a beautifully simple tool that makes that possible: iA Presenter. 

iA stands for Information Architects. They are out of Tokyo, and I actually went to their office when I was there recently. I don't think they appreciated the interruption!

Their latest [update includes](https://ia.net/topics/share-your-presentation-in-a-single-click) sharing of presentations, which is just incredible. Here's the presentation for my latest [[Big Impact Mixer]]: 

[The Presentation](https://sharing.ia.net/presenter/e380b266f44449048fda7cb60c760493/view)

There are a few awesome things I love about this update: 
1. Instant sharing on the web. No sign-in, no managing permissions, no fuss, nothing. Just easy
2. You can choose to include speaker notes, or not. 
3. Slides dynamically adjust to any screen size, so it looks good no matter what size screen it's on. 
4. Auto-expiration of 11 months. I actually like this feature. 

What would I like as an additional feature? 

An ability to embed it in my web site, like below, which I did using chatGPT to make it an iframe embed : 

<iframe 
    src="https://sharing.ia.net/presenter/e380b266f44449048fda7cb60c760493/view#/" 
    style="width: 100%; height: 100vh; border: none;" 
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

You can also export presentations in many different formats. 

I recently gave presentations at [[alasbo]] and [[akml]] and used iA Presenter, but didn't have the sharing feature yet. I'll update those notes with the correct links.
