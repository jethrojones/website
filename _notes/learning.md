## All Learning is Personal

I have deep thoughts about learning. 

I've written and spoken extensively about this topic. 

I'll start gathering those things together here. 

- [The Value of Spiritual Learning](https://jethro.site/2023/10/09/the-value-of-spiritual-learning/)
- [[Fit looks like grit]]
- [[Learning is like a Spring]]
- [Thereâ€™s no such thing as learning loss](https://jethro.site/learning/2021/03/05/What-Learning-Looks-Like/)
- 

There are many things that we need to learn that we only [[learn over time]].
