##Important Links:

[JotNot Scanner Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jotnot-scanner-pro-scan-multipage/id307868751?mt=8): My personal favorite iOS Scanner app.


[Prizmo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prizmo-scanning-ocr-speech/id366791896?mt=8): This app has been out for a while, and allegedly does OCR on the phone itself. I just learned about it this week, and I haven't had a chance to play with it, yet.


[Slide Deck from Presentation](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ehu6nuw769s3de3/UCET%202013.pdf?token_hash=AAEwaLVRLKD1uGtXnuhWRaf0KwhhsSjccDjSCixxXtHgGg&dl=1): I'll update this up until I am finished with the presentation, I am sure. ;)


##Hazel Rules to Download:



These are some of my rules that you can download for yourself. I am not sure how well they will download for you, as the movement of files is particular to your computer. I'll change their color where I would move them, and you can change that to work for you. If you have problems, shoot me an 
[email](mailto:jethro@paperlessprincipal.com).


[Sort into Subfolders](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/nyfoyjelthcfj8b/sort%20into%20subfolders.hazelrules?token_hash=AAFuQtHAt4eFWUMDdRacMpDMaxa_4pQNFJraAAKiJdCYpQ&dl=1): This is the best rule that I currently use. It is based on filenames, and adapted from a web site that is no longer with us.
