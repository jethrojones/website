In 2018, we started a program at my school called Synergy. 

Synergy is an open-ended, multi-disciplinary, real-world inquiry approach to learning. 

Our results: 

- Over 40 different projects in our school
- Student:Teacher ratio reduced to 13:1!
- Students learning *above* grade level in many areas.
- Students mastering more standards through synergy than their regular classes
- Improved student behavior in other classes, especially among our worst offenders from prior year.

Some podcast episodes [can be found here](https://transformativeprincipal.org/search?query=synergy).

I talk about how to get to this kind of change happening quickly in a school in this episode:

You can see one example of [[why-i-do-what-i-do|why I do what I do]].

One of our teams was even [featured in the local news](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155703347504051)

One of the teams started a [youtube channel to do tutoring for kids](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM5OalOMEBfWm0JJdT-1xEA "Synergy Videos").

  

Some other examples: 
- synergy TTL
- Synergy step (the one featured in the news)
- Synergy yurt
- Synergy Chess
- Synergy Ed Videos
- synergy minty business
- drama synergy group

I've [[speaking|spoken]] on this at conferences several times over the years.
