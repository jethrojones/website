One of my students (one of the instigators in my most unruly class) asked if she could teach today. I said, "Sure, go ahead!" She was probably just kidding with me, but I said she could go ahead anyway. She was excited at first, but then realized how hard it is to control this unruly class.  
  
At the end, her frustration level was so high she said, "Mr. Jones, your job is so boring. If I were you, I would quit!"  
  
It was very interesting to see how quickly she gave up. I don't really blame her, her class makes me question whether I should give up. Just kidding, sort of. It will be really interesting to see if her behavior changes in the future.
