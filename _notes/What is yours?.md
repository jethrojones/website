Shara Park is the wife of a friend of mine. As you can see from the post, she worked for a company for 18 years, and built her social media following with an account that apparently was owned by that company. 

What people must always understand is that there is an end to everything. Shara was in a panic that she lost her followers, her history of 27,000 posts, and the connections and direct messages she had. 

The job will end. 

The company will cease operations. 

The relationship will end. 

The position will end. 

What you must understand is that there is an end to everything. 

So start with an idea of how you will leave it. 

Here are a few practical tips: 
- Use a personal email address that you will have until the end of the internet to sign up for services.
- When you use a business account for something, understand that it will be gone at some point. 
- Plan for the next person to take your spot.
- Think about what it would be like if you lost access to something completely.
