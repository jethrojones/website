It's here! It's [[Big Impact Mixer]] Week! 

This month, we are focusing on experiments. 

A few months ago, when Brian was sharing his insights about job hunting, he shared that he runs lots of experiments. 

Then I heard a quote from someone that said the difference between a crazy person and a scientist is the scientist documents their experiments. 

So, I've started a couple [[experiments]]. 

We're going to talk about experiments, share yours and what you need to experiment on as well. 

Speaking of experiments, I'm trying a new experiment for setting up this event. 

A couple weeks ago, Apple released iCloud Invites, and we're going to experiment with that tool to use to invite you to this event. 

Please [RSVP here](https://www.icloud.com/invites/06fTM3knG3ZM4zr49lh2gLHgQ). Once you put in your email address, you can add the invite to your calendar. 

We had a great conversation today. I'm going to release my part as a podcast episode.
