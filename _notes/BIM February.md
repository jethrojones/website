It's here! It's [[Big Impact Mixer]] Week! 

This month, we are focusing on experiments. 

A few months ago, when Brian was sharing his insights about job hunting, he shared that he runs lots of experiments. 

Then I heard a quote from someone that said the difference between a crazy person and a scientist is the scientist documents their experiments. 

So, I've started a couple [[experiments]]. 

We're going to talk about experiments, share yours and what you need to experiment on as well. 

Speaking of experiments, I'm trying a new experiment for setting up this event. 

A couple weeks ago, Apple released iCloud Invites, and we're going to experiment with that tool to use to invite you to this event. 

Please [RSVP here](https://www.icloud.com/invites/06fTM3knG3ZM4zr49lh2gLHgQ). Once you put in your email address, you can add the invite to your calendar. 

How did that work for you? 

Thanks, 

Jethro


PS. Who is this Jethro guy and why is he hosting this event? 

I have been podcasting since 2008, in various forms. Since then, I have created the longest running, most downloaded school leadership podcast out there, Transformative Principal. I now help other people who are mission driven to create their own podcasts and connect with the right people in the right way to build powerful communities where people take action. If you want to talk about how a podcast can help you make a big impact, hit reply.
