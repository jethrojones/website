# Hi I’m Jethro!

Everyone wants to be their best selves. One problem we face is that it is too easy to fall prey to the saboteurs in our minds. As a Positive Intelligence® Coach I help people overcome those saboteurs so they can live the lives full of potential.

Most attempts at positive change fail because we stop at insight and don’t build habits. Sustained change towards a more positive mind requires laying down neural pathways to form new habits through consistent daily practice. And that’s what our PQ Program empowers you to do.

### **How it works**

### ***Daily Practice***

15 minutes/day of app-guided practice enables you to build stronger mental muscles (neural pathways). These exercises are bite-sized to fit your busy schedule and customized based on how you self-sabotage.

### ***Weekly Focus***

Weekly hour-long video delivers deep experiential exploration of the week’s focus. You’ll feel inspired and energized to practice during the week in order to sustain the benefits experienced during the video sessions.

### ***Measurable Progress***

You’ll feel motivated through instant feedback on exactly how much progress you’re making towards building the three core muscles of mental fitness. Brain rewiring may be visible in MRI imaging within eight weeks.

### ***Community Support***

We help you establish a support and accountability group with other program participants. Research has shown this to be a critical success factor for establishing lasting new positive habits of the mind.

# Six-Week Foundation

Build your foundation of mental fitness by strengthening three critical mental muscles to shift the balance of power from your inner Saboteurs (your negative self) to your inner Sage (your positive self).

-   ### Week 1: Self-Command Muscle
    
    Through a breakthrough process called PQ Reps, you get to boost your Self-Command muscle.  Each PQ Rep only takes 10 seconds and can be done with eyes open or closed. With each PQ Rep, you develop greater mastery over your own mind, quiet the negative, and activate the positive region of your brain.
    
-   ### Week 2-3: Saboteur Interceptor Muscle
    
    Description teYou get to intercept your top Saboteurs the moment they try to hijack your thoughts, feelings, and actions. In preparation for this practice, you get to expose the lies, limiting beliefs and damage of your Saboteurs, so they can no longer fool you into thinking they are helpful to you.xt goes here
    
-   ### Week 4-6: Sage Muscle
    
    You get to practice the Sage Perspective that every problem or challenge can be converted into a gift and opportunity. And you get to generate the gift through the 5 Sage Powers of Empathize, Explore, Innovate, Navigate, and Activate.

# **What Makes the PQ Program Different**

### Focus on Habit Formation

Most trainings result in short-lived improvements. For sustained results, we focus on building neural pathways that form lasting new habits. That’s why we call this “mental fitness”.

### Treat Root Cause, Not Symptoms

Our factor analysis research has revealed the foundational root-level enablers and disablers of optimal performance and wellbeing. We rewire the brain at the root cause level.

### Develop All Three Core Muscles

Mental fitness requires three core muscles. Saboteur Interceptor, Self-Command, and Sage. Meditation only focuses on Self-Command, which is why it is not sustained by most.

### One Operating System, Many Applications

Through factor analysis, we’ve discovered the core operating system of the mind that can run a massive variety of work and life applications. One simple operating system, many applications.

### A Platform for Ongoing Growth

Similar to physical fitness, mental fitness is not a short-term training. After the initial six week foundation, unlock a variety of work and life applications to continue your growth.

### Research-Based, Measurable Results

Our research has included more than a million participants from around the globe. Our tools have been field-tested with thousands of tough-minded participants, ensuring their efficacy.

## FAQ
-   ### Is this the right program for me?
    
    This is the right program for you if you are a) committed to improving your performance and effectiveness dramatically while reducing stress, b) looking for a science-based and trusted system to make it stick, and c) willing to put in the initial effort to rewire years of mental habits that don’t serve you.
    
-   ### Aren't negative emotions sometimes helpful?
    
    Some people believe that negative emotions are helpful. For example, they think stress gives them their performance edge, or beating themselves or others up is helpful for continual improvement.
    
    Feeling pain for a split second when your hand touches a hot stove is indeed useful, delivering an important alert. But your Saboteurs keep your hand on the hot stove, continuing to feel negative emotions which harm both performance and happiness.
    
    In this program we learn to use negative emotions as a helpful alert, and then quickly shift to the positive region of the brain that has the calm clarity, objectivity, and creativity to handle the challenge most effectively.
    
-   ### How much time and effort is required
    
    You’d be committing to watching a one-hour video once per week and doing a combined total of 15 minutes per day of practice guided by the Positive Intelligence app exclusively designed for this program.
    
    This might sound like a lot of time. In fact, cumulatively, it constitutes less than 2% of your awake time for the duration of the program. Please consider that your Saboteurs are costing you far more than 2% of your time, effort, energy, and productivity. Consider how much more than 2% of time and productivity this six-weeks investment will save for years to come.
    
-   ### How is this different from reading the book?
    
    You’d never learn to ride a bicycle by reading a book about it. You’ll be asked to read the first eight chapters of the book while participating in the program. The book provides the research foundation and introduces the tools. The video session guides you through experiential exercises that help you personalize the tools to your own personality and needs. And the app coaches you to practice one tool at a time in the context of your own daily work and life challenges.
    
-   ### Should we participate as a team?
    
    Even though the focus of the program is individual development, team leaders often call this experience the best team building experience they have ever had. Going through this program together significantly deepens trust, helps clear the air related to recurrent team member conflicts since they’re mostly generated by Saboteurs, and gives the entire team a common framework for helping each other grow, making decisions, responding to setbacks, and managing conflicting styles and agendas.
