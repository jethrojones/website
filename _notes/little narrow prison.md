Our words are incapable of truly expressing what we know inside. I love this description of the inadequacy of our words to describe the amazing things we can know and understand, especially spiritually. 
> Joseph ended the letter with a prayer for the time when the two of them should “gaze upon eternal wisdom engraven upon the heavens, while the majesty of our God holdeth up the dark curtain until we may read the round of eternity.” Then at last, he hoped, they might be delivered “from the little, narrow prison, almost as it were, total darkness of paper, pen and ink;—and a crooked, broken, scattered and imperfect language.”[\[4\]](https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-1-no-1-2000/#_note-4)
