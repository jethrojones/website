# Reflections on the SPELL JIF Conference: The Evolving AI Universe in Public Education

This week I had the privilege of presenting at the **[[SPELL JIF Retreat]] in New Jersey**, where education leaders gathered to explore one of the most pressing topics in schools today: **Artificial Intelligence**.  

My session, _The Evolving AI Universe in Public Education_, focused on helping leaders ask better questions about AI, see where it can create meaningful change, and rethink what success in school should look like . We explored:

- Why AI policies alone don’t move practice—because nobody reads them.
- How AI can free up cognitive resources so educators focus on the work only people can do.
- What it means to shift from “old paradigms” like homework and test scores to **real work, evidence, and authentic assessment**.
- Practical ways AI can take on repetitive tasks so educators can slow down with individuals, build trust, and spark curiosity .
## What Anonymous Attendees Said

The feedback from participants was both humbling and energizing:

> “Excellent presentation. I liked the way he wove his personal story into his presentation and gave real life examples of how AI has helped his daughter.”

> “This presentation was absolutely amazing! Just an eye opener to what kinds of things AI can do, the good and the bad.”

> “This was an eye-opening presentation. I was so engaged. Jethro made the topic very interesting. I learned so much and can bring what I learned to my new position.”

  > “AI has been a fear of mine with students and staff. This program gives me something to build on when I get back.”

> “Very engaging and thoughtful presentation. The session was very beneficial. Would like my IT manager to attend the session.”  

One participant summed it up perfectly:  

> “Very informative and increased my desire to utilize AI.”
## Why This Matters

As Ethan Mollick has said, “Knowing when to use AI turns out to be a form of wisdom, not just technical knowledge” . That wisdom is exactly what leaders need right now—to discern where AI accelerates meaningful progress and where it risks undermining learning.

At SPELL JIF, I was encouraged to see so many leaders leaning into that conversation with curiosity, courage, and hope.
## Let’s Continue the Conversation

If your district, association, or conference is ready to have a meaningful conversation about AI and education, I’d love to partner with you.
