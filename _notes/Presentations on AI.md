# AI Presentations

[[Speaking]]

I do a variety of presentations about AI. You can see information about those below. 

Each month, I conduct [AILeader Office Hours](https://jethro.webinarninja.com/series-webinars/6143/register) where I take questions from attendees about how they want to use AI. These are wide-ranging and cover many different topics. You can register [here](https://jethro.webinarninja.com/series-webinars/6143/register). 

My approach to AI is simple: It's a tool. We need to use AI to enhance relationships, not circumvent them. We need to use AI to deepen the things that make us human, not roboticize everything. 

Because AI is changing rapidly, I don't reuse the same AI presentations, so these are presented below as summaries of the types of things I talk about. Unfortunately for me, I have to constantly update to suit the audience and changing landscape. 

If you would like to have me speak at your event, please [get in touch](mailto:jethro@transformativeprincipal.com).

Here are just some of the topics that I've presented on:

## Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to Make Casper, Wyoming's City Policies Easily Accessible

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI approach that combines the strengths of information retrieval with generative AI to make complex data more accessible and user-friendly. By applying this method to Casper, Wyoming’s city policies, residents and officials can easily find answers to their questions in natural language.

Here’s how RAG can be used to improve access to city policies:

1. **Instant Access to Policy Information**:
   RAG enables users to ask questions about Casper’s city policies in natural language (e.g., “What are the regulations for starting a food truck in Casper?”). The AI retrieves the most relevant information from policy documents and provides clear, accurate answers, making city guidelines easier to understand.

2. **Natural Language Understanding**:
   Unlike traditional search engines, RAG allows users to ask questions conversationally. For example, “How do I apply for a building permit?” will retrieve specific instructions from Casper’s building codes, without needing to know the exact wording of the policy.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   RAG ensures that the most up-to-date versions of city policies are referenced. If Casper updates a zoning law or changes a traffic ordinance, the AI can pull the latest information and present it accurately, without outdated responses.

4. **Contextual Awareness**:
   When asked complex questions, such as “What is the process for contesting a parking ticket in Casper?” RAG retrieves relevant information from different policy sections, integrating them into a single, coherent answer, saving users the hassle of searching multiple documents.

5. **Customized for Local Needs**:
   By tailoring RAG specifically for Casper’s policy documents, it can handle local terms and contexts better than generic search systems. For example, if someone asks about “pet licensing rules,” the AI will retrieve Casper-specific guidelines, rather than generic advice for any city.

**Example Scenario:**
A Casper resident wants to know how to open a small business. They can ask the RAG system, “What are the steps to start a small business in Casper, Wyoming?” The AI pulls relevant information from city policies, licensing procedures, and zoning regulations and provides a comprehensive, easy-to-understand guide. Citations are provided naturally: 

- "According to Casper's Business Licensing Guidelines, you must first register with the Wyoming Secretary of State (Casper Policy §123.45)."
- "You’ll also need to comply with zoning regulations for your business location (Zoning Ordinance §67.89)."

This approach makes navigating city policies more accessible for everyone, from residents to business owners, improving transparency and public engagement with city regulations.

## Using AI to Deepen the Student-Teacher Relationship

AI can enhance the student-teacher bond by:

1. **Personalized Learning**: Tailoring lessons to each student’s needs helps teachers provide more targeted support.
2. **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant feedback frees up teachers to focus on deeper discussions and mentoring.
3. **Better Communication**: AI tools facilitate student-teacher communication outside of class, improving accessibility.
4. **Identifying Student Needs**: AI detects when students are struggling, helping teachers offer timely emotional support.
5. **More Time for Connection**: Automating tasks gives teachers more time for relationship-building and personal feedback.

By streamlining tasks and personalizing learning, AI allows teachers to focus more on connecting with and supporting their students.

## Using AI to Build a Culture of Human Connection

AI can play a key role in fostering a culture of connection by helping automate tasks, freeing up time, and enhancing the ways people engage with one another. Here’s how AI can help build a culture centered on human relationships:

1. **Freeing Time for Human Interaction**: By automating administrative tasks (scheduling, data entry, etc.), AI gives people more time to focus on meaningful conversations and relationship-building.
   
2. **Personalized Communication**: AI can analyze communication preferences and help customize messages, ensuring more thoughtful and personalized interactions that resonate on a human level.

3. **Facilitating Collaboration**: AI tools promote collaboration by helping teams share ideas, streamline workflows, and offer real-time feedback, making it easier for people to work together and connect meaningfully.

4. **Identifying Opportunities for Engagement**: AI can track engagement patterns and suggest moments for leaders to check in with their teams, celebrating successes or providing support when needed.

5. **Creating Inclusive Environments**: AI-driven tools can analyze team dynamics and help leaders ensure inclusivity, enabling everyone to feel heard and valued in group settings.

In essence, AI helps create more time and space for genuine human interactions, fostering a culture of connection, empathy, and collaboration.

## How to Get AI to Write in Your Own Voice

1. **Provide Samples of Your Writing**: Share multiple examples of your writing style with the AI. The more examples you give, the better it will understand your tone, word choice, and sentence structure.

2. **Be Specific in Your Prompts**: When using AI, include details about how you want the text to sound. For example, you can specify: “Write this in a casual, conversational tone with short sentences, similar to my blog posts.”

3. **Train the AI**: Some platforms allow you to "train" the AI on specific data. Upload documents or writing samples so it learns to mimic your style over time.

4. **Edit for Fine-Tuning**: AI won't always get your voice perfect on the first try. After it generates text, revise it to make sure it matches your natural style, and over time, it will improve.

5. **Use Consistent Prompts**: Stay consistent with the instructions you give the AI. For example, if you often describe your style as "casual and friendly," always use similar prompts so it can recognize patterns.

By regularly providing examples, clear instructions, and feedback, AI can better replicate your unique voice in writing.
