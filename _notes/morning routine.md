Here's my current morning routine:

{% if page.image %} <img src="{{ page.image }}" alt=""> {% endif %}

5:00 am - wake up, study scriptures, read, a little social media (need to stop this part), text my family a spiritual thought. 
6:00 am - walk to the gym, do a workout, walk back home (see [[How I lost 70 pounds in one year through a fad diet and a much simpler, more sustainable way]])
7:00-8:30 am - depending on the day, the order changes, cold plunge, shower, make breakfast for me and Staci
8:30 - start work
