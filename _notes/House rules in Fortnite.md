> We play a lot of [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/) at our house. It's a great game for teaching kids cooperative discipline, and in a remarkably wholesome setting to boot (no blood, cartoon styling). I've had no qualms involving all three of our boys from an early age in the family squad, including our two youngest from around age four.  
  

Since we started playing, I've just had two primary house rules:  
  

1. Stay together.
2. No complaining.

  
Sounds simple, but it's ever-so tempting to stray from the squad to chase your own goal of getting better gear, and it comes easy to blame your brother when the other team gets you. Especially when you're still a preschooler!
