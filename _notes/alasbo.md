### AI Summaries
There were two recordings of our presentation today. [Here's the first one from Bonnie](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/aoakgncda958ddkcj2dx4/12-08_Lecture_AI_in_Education_-_Integration_and_Problem_Solving.pdf?rlkey=cmwbbfi006e0q9uumhjxtnu7i&dl=0). A couple things to note from this one: It got some good highlights. I'm not sure what Bonnie had to do to identify speakers, but it got my quotes right, so that's cool. 

And here is [the second one from Dana](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gt4pl6qt2z8z1r1oirs25/12-08-AI-Lecture-Notes-from-Dana.pdf?rlkey=qbn2r68315xv55e7hhbemjvr9&st=w0yly0uc&dl=0). I don't recall what app she was using for that one. But please notice how it got everyone's introductions correctly, too. Impressive.
