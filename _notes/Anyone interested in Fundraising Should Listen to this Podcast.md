If you are at all interested in fundraising for your school, then you need to clear your calendar and listen to:

Why Your Fundraiser Flopped By John Mihalyo on Catholic School Leaders. https://cslp.bepodcast.network/episodes/why-did-your-school-not-reach-their-fundraising-goals

And here's why:


First, a little street cred: John has raised millions of dollars through his fundraising, and he now teachers catholic elementary schools how to increase their fundraising. This guy knows his stuff.

#1: John lists out 13 reasons why your fundraiser isn't working out how you want, and what you can do to make it better.



#2: Don't be like 4 year old soccer players: Don't rush after every great fundraising idea. Make a plan, Give yourself time, and follow through.


#3: He explains the difference between Fundraising and Friendraising ðŸ¤¯


#4: John explains how to do a post-mortem (even before you start) and evaluate whether your event was successful in your larger idea of creating a culture of giving at your school.

#5: Sponsorships - John talks about how to greatly increase your fundraising by including sponsorships in addition to what you're already doing.

I just hit the highlights. There's much more in the episode

Honestly, this podcast is one I wish I had when I was still a principalâ€”and completely changed the way I think about school fundraising.

I can't believe stuff like this is free on the Internet.
