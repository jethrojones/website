A friend of mine recently hired me to do some work for him. 

He is a very inspiring guy himself, and I love doing work with friends. I want him to succeed, so I am motivated to help him. He described the work to me and to be honest, I didn't really feel like it was awesome work, but it was something I knew I could do. 

So, I was a little reluctant to get started. You know, just being human. 

But then, once I started digging in and seeing how I could improve his company, I was hooked. I spent three hours on it one day and it felt like time just flew by. I was making a real impact. 

The really amazing thing is that he could see my value, even when I wasn't sure. I love that about people.
