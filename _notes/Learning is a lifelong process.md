I recently saw this quote from Carl Jung, and while I don't have the source, I saved the picture. Regardless of the citation, the idea here is exceptionally valuable. 

> "At present we educate people only up to the point where they can earn a living and marry; then education ceases  altogether, as though a complete mental outfit had been acquired. ... Vast numbers of men and women thus spend their entire lives in complete ignorance of the most important things." Carl Jung

If we see education as the finite time that kids are in K-12, we miss many opportunities. 

Lots of schools say that they believe in helping their students become "lifelong learners" but they don't do the things that make them lifelong learners. 

Learning is about so much more than what you learn in school, and we do a disservice to students by leading them to believe that this finite time is all that matters. 

This is one of my [[Assumptions]] at the base of my educational theories.
