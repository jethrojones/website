##Have you ever been nervous or anxious to approach your boss?


##Your employees have been nervous approaching you too!


These cards make the conversation easy. By showing a card when you first meet, you set the topic for the meeting, and both parties can be on the same page about the goal of the conversation.

The following cards are included:

*I have a storyline


*I made a mistake


*I need help solving a problem


*I need to vent


*I have a crisis in my personal life


*It’s all about the money


*I want to brag
