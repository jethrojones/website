We sure love Latin food. We had Guatemalan food this month, and it was such a beautiful day we ate outside. 

One of the best things about these [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]] meals is that we all learn some new food together and everyone contributes. 

Our recipes: 
- [Almojábanas](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/9426E974-61F5-4833-AC9A-90B74B6811E2?locale=en) (cheese rolls)
- [Ceviche](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/9426E974-61F5-4833-AC9A-90B74B6811E2?locale=en) - shrimp, cucumber, onions, clamato juice, and avocados. 
- [Frijoles Cubanos](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/C8535234-44F0-483F-81C0-60EF5DB8DBC2?locale=en) - beans and onions. 
- [Guatemalan Tostadas](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/188EE076-72CF-43D9-B478-C3FED4FF587F?locale=en) 
- [Besitos de coco](https://recipes.crouton.app/recipes/B8DC8497-EAEB-4F27-99ED-78C0A6EE84D4?locale=en)  - Coconut cookies. These were quite good.
