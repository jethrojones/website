Praising kids is manipulation and naturally creates an adversarial relationship. 

When you praise someone, you are creating a hierarchal relationship, and that means that you are seeing them as beneath you. 

Consider this example. A father is cleaning the garage, and says to the person helping, "You're such a good helper!"

If he says that to his child, you'd agree that probably make sense because we accept praise as a normal part of society.

If he says that to his wife, you'd say that was probably misogynistic, because you know that sounds like he is talking down to someone. 

Praise signifies that you are on a higher level than someone else. 

Praise makes people believe they have no ability. Praise is judgment passed by someone who with ability to someone who does not have ability. 

Rather than praise, express words of gratitude based on a horizontal relationship. 

Judgment comes out of vertical relationships. 

Rather than praise, express gratitude clearly to that person. 

Gratitude helps someone feel they are beneficial to the community, and that is more powerful than any praise could be.
