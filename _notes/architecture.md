There's this idea that architecture carries deep spiritual symbolism. And since I believe [[2023-10-09-spiritual-learning|all things are spiritual]], I had some deeper thoughts about it. 

So, is it a spiritual and symbolic profession or experience?[^1] 

Number one, it's tied to the idea of creation. Creating is a spiritual experience; there's spirituality in it. You can't avoid that when you're creating something meant to survive over time, unlike something built out of paper or other temporary materials.

The second point is that building tools and methods are also spiritual and symbolic by nature. It's not just about creating something; the tools you use are imbued with spirituality and symbolism as well.

The third point is that for a structure to last long enough to remain viable, you need to think deeply about its creation. Building a hut with a straw roof might have some symbolism, but if you want to create something that lasts for hundreds of years, you need to make thoughtful decisions. Without that depth of thought, you won't make the right choices to ensure its longevity.

Those are a few of my ideas on the question.
