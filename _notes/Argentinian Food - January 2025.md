We are continuing our practice of our [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]]! It is so much fun to make new and interesting foods from cultures we have not experienced before. 

This month it is Argentinian food. 

Asado is grilled meat, which we are grateful for, because it is one of our favorite things to eat! It is supposed to be grilled over an open flame, but in the absence of that, we are using our smoker, and that will have to do this time! 

Provoleta is a grilled cheese dish made from provolone. I’ve always found provolone to be strong in flavor for my taste, so this will not be like burrata which I could eat all by myself easily. 

Alfrajores, Dulce de Leche cookies are our dessert, and Cali prepped those last night. 

Finally, we have some salsa, and we made a lot! So we will have this for the next few weeks! It is essentially Argentinian pico de gallo. 

Here are our recipes:

For the meat, we just put some Adobo seasoning on it and grilled it at 250°F for a while, then cut it up into small slices. 

And some pictures.
