It seems that all the apps and creations out there right now are encouraging us to be consumers, not creators. 

Netflix, Social Media, music, books, it seems everything is geared towards making you be a consumer. 

When you are a consumer, you are acted upon, rather than taking action yourself. There are many problems with this, the biggest of which is that you are not in control of your own will and agency when you are being acted upon. 

This even happens in school. In my doctoral program, I was given an assignment, but it was not a good assignment. 

[Elder David A Bednar](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/video/2012-08-1320-things-to-act-and-things-to-be-acted-upon?lang=eng) said: 

> In the grand division of all of God's creations, there are things to act and things to be acted upon. As sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, we have been blessed with the gift of moral agency, the capacity for independent action and choice. Endowed with agency, you and I are agents, and we primarily are to act and not just be acted upon. To believe that someone or something can make us feel offended, angry, hurt, or bitter diminishes our moral agency and transforms us into objects to be acted upon. As agents, however, you and I have the power to act and to choose how we will respond to an offensive or hurtful situation.
