Through my many connections over the years, I planted seeds and prepared for things. It's always amazing to see what blossoms from those seeds. 

Today, I had the first advisory meeting of ISTAR (Integrated Strategic, Technology-based Adaptive wRiting) Program. 

They received a grant to develop this with AI capabilities, specifically supporting students to write effectively in close collaboration with teachers. I'm really excited about being part of this project. 

Here's [the project page](https://kucrl.ku.edu/istar-project).
