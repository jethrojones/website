# Why do all education-related photographs and designs have to be so ugly and useless? 


If you have ever asked this question, you are ​not alone. Thousands of educators across the world want to present lessons to their students that contain beautiful content to match their awesome teaching skills. 

​Fill out the form below to request that ​a designer or photographer creates a special piece of work just for you, for FREE!

#The Rules


*Requests should be for a small project (1-2 photos or designs). 


*Artists should be able to complete requests in about 30 minutes or less. ​


*The more detail the better. If the artist can envision what you want based on your description, they will be more willing to donate their time to help you.

Frequently asked questions are below the form. ​

#FAQ



##How big should my request be?



We ask teachers to request in small increments. We want our professionals to spend about 30-60 minutes on these requests.


##What if I don't like what the artist gives me?



You may have said to your students, "You get what you get, and you don't throw a fit!" You should still send some gratitude to the artist, because he or she did take time out of her life to try and help you. Remember that the better you describe what you want, the better off you are.


##How much should I describe what I am requesting?



More is more! Describe as much as you can. If you need to draw it, and then take a picture of it and upload it somewhere, that is fine. If you have something that it should look like, that would be good to add to the description as well.


##How long should I wait for the request to be donated?



We ask the donors to not claim a request unless they can fill it within one week. If they can't get it done in that timeframe, they should pass on it.


##Can I see what other people have requested and had done?



When donors finish a request, they have the option to offer the donated item for sale on this site. That way, if it is crunch time, you can buy a piece, or you can wait a week to have a piece donated. Since artists will only sell items to be used in educational settings, the prices will remain low.
