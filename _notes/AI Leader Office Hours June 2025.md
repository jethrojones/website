Our prompt for the EduAction Daily web site we created: 
```
I want to create a web site that sends them a text message for daily action they can take to support education. they can learn about school board meetings and add them to their calendar, volutneer at kids' schools, write letters of support to superintendnets and principals and school boards, find out who your legistaltors are who vote on education issues and hold them accountable. and then create a ton more of small, daily actions as a resource that can be sent out each day. The idea is to get people to take action quickly, and daily.
```
