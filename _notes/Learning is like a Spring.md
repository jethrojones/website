Most people can accept the below diagram of what [[learning]] looks like: 

![Learning Circle](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/learningcircle.png&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

Or at least something like it. 

This is a two dimensional version of it. 

But here it is in a 3 dimensional version: 

![learning Spring](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/learningspring.png&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

Learning happens in different ways at different times, and so much more goes into it beyond these four characteristics. Sometimes, the time between learning things is vast. One rotation through the spring could be a decade, because some things you can only [[learn over time]].
