My friend Damon wrote a post about the [26 forms of accelerated learning](https://world.hey.com/hargraves/forms-of-accelerated-learning-b33be7b4).

I'd break this list up like this:   
## Systemic
- Advanced Placement courses - AP classes
- Accelerated/honors high school classes
- Accelerated residential high school
- Concurrent/dual enrollment classes
- Early entrance to kindergarten or first grade
- Compacted Curriculum
- International Baccalaureate program
- Summer university classes
- Saturday classes on university campus
- Early admission to university - can happen before a high school diploma is given
- Multi-grade combination
- Non-graded/multi-age classroom
## Outside Organization
- Credit by examination
- Competitions
- Mentorship
- Radical acceleration - four years of high school are combined with the first four years of college
## Individual
- Computer on-line courses - asynchronous independent learning
- Distance education courses - synchronous classes, usually online
- Home Schooling
- Honors classes at university
- Independent study
- Individualized acceleration - continuous content that is accelerated based on student needs, there is no grade placement due to age
- Single-subject acceleration
- Talent search programs
- Grade skipping
- Grade telescoping

  
Actually, I think a Venn diagram would be more helpful. Except, there's not much that would fit in the middle circle that overlaps all three.  

Another problem with this list is that each of these except independent study and possibly homeschool require the institution to "bless" the acceleration. The thing that I'm struggling how to define is that learning is exceptionally personal, in and of itself.   
  
Even though you may take the same course as someone else, there's no way to guarantee that they both are getting the same education. They're still getting their own version of that education.   
  
What I mean is education is personalized no matter what. And acceleration is personalized also, but we have to navigate through a system  
  
I posted this also, if you want to write a followup: jethro.site/acceleration
