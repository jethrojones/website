Why do people choose the things they choose? It's rarely about features.

> we like *being the kind of people who use and appreciate 37signals products*.

This explains so much more than product comparisons ever could. We go to this school because we like being the kind of people who go to this school. We use this tool because we like being the kind of people who use this tool. We join this community because we like being the kind of people who belong to this community.

Identity drives decisions far more than utility.

> Once you decide that a company deliberately owns a particular concept, you can interpret literally everything they do as reinforcing that concept.

This is the trap of hindsight thinking. Once we've determined something to be true, we filter all past decisions through that lens. We see how every choice "fits" with the narrative we've constructed—even if that wasn't the reason the decision was made at all.

We do this with companies. We do this with leaders. We do this with ourselves.

The story we tell after the fact isn't the story that was lived. But it's the story we believe.
