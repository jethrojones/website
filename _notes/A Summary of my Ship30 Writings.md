I spent the last 30 days doing the Ship 30 for 30 writing course with my daughter. This has been an incredible experience with several benefits. 

I'll share my three main benefits and then include all my posts here. 

Here are three: 

1. **Daddy-Daughter Time**
My 12 year old has been writing on her blog. She went through several different ideas, but what was great was her finding a groove that works for her. Her Coffee Connections story is great. 
1. **Improved Speaking from Writing**
I mentioned this in one of the days but my speaking became much better because of my writing. I gave two incredible presentations last week with the best feedback I've ever received. I was on fire--because I was writing. 
1. **Confidence**
Writing made my thinking clear and made my writing better, too. I've been writing every day for years, but most of that is not published. Nor have I kept track of it! I feel more confident in my thoughts when I write them first. 

Here's all my writings (numbers 14, 26, 19, and 32 were the most popular):
