I write in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

Publish using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Initiate publishing automatically based on committing to github. This is the [base theme](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

I'm not a coder, but I can still do this. 

I do have a rule. As of January 25, 2025, I can only post new notes if they are related to something else on the site. 

This started as things became more difficult to find. There are almost 2000 total posts on the site. I still have to figure out how to bring all my posts in to this Obsidian vault so they don't break all my links. 

I want them to all be connected, and that will just take time, but I think that graph view at the bottom of each note would be much more powerful if every note was connected to at least one other.
