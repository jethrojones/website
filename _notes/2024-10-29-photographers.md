#Want to donate your photos/designs to help students? 


If so, hit the 
[request board](http://paperlessprincipal.com/donation-requests). ​More information can be found below. 

##How does this help students?


Your donation will save a teachers time spent in something she is not great at so she can focus on something she is great at: teaching students. When teachers have to waste time finding images or designs to use, they are taking away precious time from preparing to teach their students. Many teachers want to use beautiful works of art to communicate concepts, but they are unable to because they can't produce them, and they can't afford to buy them.​

##What do I get out of this? 


You get not only the satisfaction that your work is going to be seen by many students, but you can also request that this donation be a tax exemption. Consult your taxman about this. Schools will provide you with their tax ID numbers so that you can deduct the in-kind donation from your taxes. ​

##Why should I spend so much time creating something for schools? 


We ask teachers to make requests that are small. If the request would take you more than about 30-60 minutes, please give us that feedback. A teacher may need an alphabet wall (a picture for each letter of the alphabet). She should do a separate request for each letter (or every couple letters). If you would like to donate the whole alphabet, you can claim each request. ​

##How soon should I complete a request? 


We ask that you complete it within a week of claiming it. Some items are time-sensitive and need to be completed quicker than that. The teacher will note if that is the case. Otherwise, teachers should expect a week turnaround from the time you claim the request.  ​

##How do I claim a request? 


You claim a request simply by adding a comment to the bottom. When you claim a request, you will be emailed the contact information for the teacher, and she will be emailed your contact information. ​

##What if the teacher doesn't like what I produce? 


A common saying in education is "You get what you get and you don't throw a fit!" Teachers understand that you are donating your time and skills. They are well aware that whatever you create is much better than what they can create or find, and will likely love it so much your head may explode from pride. ​​

##What if the donation request is too big? 


If the donation request is to big for you, don't claim it. If something is unclaimed after a week, we send it back to the teacher and ask them to rewrite and modify it so that it is a better fit for you. Teachers also have the option of posting jobs that they are willing to pay for. For example, if a teacher wants an alphabet wall to include a certain theme in every picture, then she may ask that one photographer takes all the pictures, and she would allow people to bid on that job. Those can be found 
[here](http://paperlessprincipal.com/job-requests)​. 

##What do you mean "donate"? 


You will be donating your photograph with a non-exclusive license in a digital format to a teacher to use in her classroom in any way she wants. She can make copies, print it, and publish it on the web, but she can only use it for her classroom and to benefit her students. ​You retain the rights to reproduce the photo for whatever you want, and to sell it if you choose. You may also sell it on this web site. 

##


##If I am selling it, is that still donating it? 


Yes, your donation is for that one teacher that requests it and that is all. If you would like to donate it again, you may, at your discretion, to as many teachers as you want. This web site will sell some products that have been produced for other teachers here, but will sell them only to educational institutions and will sell them comparatively inexpensively. If you choose to, you may sell your items here. Selling the items will include the same non-exclusive, school use only.
