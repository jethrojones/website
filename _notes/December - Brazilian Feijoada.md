When I was a kid, my dad loved to reminisce about his time as a missionary in Northern Brazil back in the late sixties. 

Living somewhere for two years, and devoting your life during that time to serving those people and helping them come closer to Christ develops some strong relationships, traditions, and beliefs. 

One of those is Feijoada (which I didn't know how to spell before this weekend's Fast Sunday Family Feast). 

For our [[Fast Sunday Family Feast]] this month, we had feijoada, cheese rolls, bregideiro, and a√ßai bowls with fresh fruit (dragon fruit, honey mango, banana, coconut, granola).

It tasted like my childhood!
