Your kids are never going to remember a lecture you give or a lesson you teach them. But they will remember the little things you do to help them grow and develop. 

Playing cars with them on the floor. Sharing why you made a decision. 

Things that seem inconsequential to you will be the foundation for their identity.

For some people that fills them with anxiety thinking every little moment matters so much that it has to be perfect. 

Quite the opposite is true. 

They’ll only see and remember your authenticity. So, whoever you are striving to be is more important than who you are at that moment.

This is why [[learning]] and [[teaching]] are so important and why they must be differentiated, paid attention to, and understood in a deeper way.
