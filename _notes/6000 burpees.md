## Lessons Learned
- Starting is hard, every. single. time. 
- Increasing to 15 in a set really made a mental difference. It's not that much harder to do 15 than 10 in a set, but the mental hurdle of starting a set is the biggest barrier. 
- many times I would be pondering something while I did it and would be surprised I completed my set so quickly. 
- When I started, I couldn't get "pop" up, I had to go to my knees, then stand up. 
- I can do 15 burpees in less than a minute. When I started, it took 3 minutes.
