Talk about exciting! Everybody comes to back-to-school night in a good mood. If anyone is not happy it is because they didn't get a teacher that they wanted. I am sure that happens a lot, but we didn't hear anything about it last night. It was so fun to go and look at the teachers' rooms and see what they are doing and how they are preparing for school. It was so much fun. I love this job.  
  
Back-to-school night is a good time to make some comments to the parents, and let them see your great school. A few people commented on how nice the school looked. This is a perfect opportunity to build up your teachers and sell yourself and the school to the community. The people who come to back-to-school night are the involved people, and they will be part of the school's goings-on. Make them love it.  
  
Mrs. P. and I spent the day interviewing the teachers, wait, she called it "visiting" with the teachers. I really enjoyed getting to know them and learn about them and what they thought needed to be done at this school, as Mrs. P. did ask them point-blank what they thought needed to change. I think that a lot of the teachers want things to be better here. Many of them have their own ideas of what needs to change, but they all pretty much agree that something needs to change. I don't think anyone said everything was perfect. I am glad that we got to know everybody and can now understand a little better where they are coming from.  
  
Today was a long day, and I was tired when I went home, but I enjoy doing this so much that it is not a big deal. I wake up in the morning and I am again excited to go to work and get things done.  
  
Have a Good Life.
