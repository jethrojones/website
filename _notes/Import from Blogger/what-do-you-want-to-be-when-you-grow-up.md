I had a chat with one of our really great kids at my school today. While we were talking, I asked him what he wants to be when he grows up. He said, "When I grow up, I just want to be a good dad and be there for my family."  
  
This kid [gets it](http://www.flickr.com/photos/36425193@N00/312039851/). He knows what is important in life. What is really important. It is not about money, careers, fame, or anything else. It is about being a good dad who is there for his family.  
  
This kid is going to Have a Good Life.
