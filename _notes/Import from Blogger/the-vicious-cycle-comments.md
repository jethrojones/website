Dear Jethro  
you may not want to share this, but I know that you are correct in your resoning. when I was young i never heard my dad tell me he loved me until, I was a junior in high school. I was determined to change that and to tell my kids that i loved them and to encourage them that they could do anything. sometimes that was hard to do, but most of the time i did it. I am glad you went to Andrea and Jasons and for the good effect they had on you as well as your concilar at high school. i love you. dad

Mr. Jones,  
What a great blog. It is true that people often find themselves in a "Vicious Cycle". I only wish there were more teachers like you. You are such a valuable tool to these kids. You change and inspire the lives of hundreds. What a great blessing and challenge. Keep up the good work. There are going to be more hard times than easy times, but it will all worth it knowing that you helped to inspire these kids to become better individuals. You rock!!!!
