Great stuff here, Jethro, and I'm not really talking about your post.  
  
If you hadn't written it, though, I wouldn't know Katya as well, nor would I understand some of the life experiences that have made you you.  
  
Life is a difficult challenge. I appreciate you and your willingness to publicly share some of the more personal things in your life. Have a good life, Jethro. You deserve it.
