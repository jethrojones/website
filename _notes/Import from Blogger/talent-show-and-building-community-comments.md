Good ideas Jethro. Sadly in today's society no place is safe, especially schools, to not have people check in at the office. It would be awesome to have more parents be able to help out in school and make it possible for them to do it. Parent involvement is essential to student's success and too bad it doesn't happen enough.

I like your idea about Ustreaming your class. Please take a look at [www.parents.ourschool.ca](http://www.parents.ourschool.ca) for some ideas. I want to comment on the definition that you are using to describe parent involvement. It certainly is exciting to have parents volunteer in the classroom but there are several other ways to engage parents without them volunteering. Please wonder over to [www.parents.ourschool.ca](http://www.parents.ourschool.ca) and [www.ourschool.ca/NiagaraCatholic](http://www.ourschool.ca/NiagaraCatholic) for more ideas on how parents can help support their children.

Staci, thanks for your comment, and I agree, it probably will never be the same as it was before Columbine, but it is nice to dream. I just wish there were a way.  
  
Lorna, thanks for the great resources. I will definitely be utilizing some of those great ideas when I am a principal, and hopefully I can incorporate some things now. I am trying use Ustream right now (bureaucracy is preventing that) and I will be using Skype soon, I hope. We have a wiki, but I am still struggling with getting parents to be involved. I think I am missing a major step, I need to explicitly invite them to participate.
