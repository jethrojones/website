Jethro is joined by Jeff Paul ([@okprincipal)](https://twitter.com/okprincipal), principal of Smith Elementary, where he had the unique opportunity to take over for a principal who had been there for the previous 25 years! 

In this part of the two-part interview, Jeff talks about the challenges and positives associated with his unique situation. He also talks about the evaluation system his district recently started. 

I hope you enjoy this. Please tweet, post on facebook, or email to share it with your principal friends. 

Also, if you have someone that you think is a transformative principal, please let me know who they are by emailing me at [jethro.jones@gmail.com](mailto://jethrojones@gmail.com). Or you can hit me up on twitter [@jethrojones](https://twitter.com/jethrojones).
