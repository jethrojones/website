I just completed the Engaged Classroom training: a four-day course that covered a book and a bunch of social/web tools. It was pretty intense, and I think that a lot of people are overwhelmed. Below is a picture of the stuff that we got (I used [Delicious Library 2](http://www.delicious-monster.com/) to get that all organized).

I am so excited to do this. I have the tools now to do stuff. That has been the biggest hurdle for me.  
  
I am required to train two other teachers to use these tools: [Matt](http://shakehistoryclass.blogspot.com/) and [Melinda](http://mlesueur.wordpress.com/). Matt is a self-proclaimed technophobe, but he is coming along. I think my biggest challenge with him is the actual implementation of the tools. I think that if I work with him over the summer, he will be good to go. He just needs to start using these tools.  
  
Melinda is pretty savvy, and I think she will need direction to find what is good for her class. She is still new, and teaches a heavy curriculum, but I think that she will come along nicely, as well.  
  
The best thing is that I really like both of them. Matt and Melinda are awesome, and I am very lucky that I get to teach with them. They are both very accommodating, eager to learn, and flexible. I am really looking forward to this Engaged Classroom program.  
  
The biggest concern that I have is the time that it will take to teach the students to use these tools. Some of them will "get it" and some won't. Some will be so engrossed I will have to pry the technology away from them, and some won't care at all.  
  
I think the key is to make sure that I am not forcing them to use the tools, but making an environment that will be conducive to them learning with a lot of failures will be crucial. I think I am up to the task.  
  
This is not going to be an easy thing to do, but it will be worth it, I think.  
  
Have a Good Life.
