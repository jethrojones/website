Which of the ebook readers, then, is your favorite - and which have you yet to try?

Darren,  
  
The [[the-kindle|Kindle]] is my favorite. I have tried the big 3 (Sony, Amazon, and B&N) but I have not tried the readers created by lesser-known companies.

I'm not sure how you maintain that navigation on the Nook is "more intuitive" than on the Kindle. There's no hiding the fact that the Nook's thin strip of color touch screen is merely a gimmick designed to appeal to the iPod/iPad consumer. Aside from being generally useless, it soaks up battery life in a terrible fashion.
