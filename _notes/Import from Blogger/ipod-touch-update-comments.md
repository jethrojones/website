Have you looked at any hardware alternatives? There are a couple other companies that make mp3/web browsing devices that compare to the iPod Touch's functionality. That's not to say that the iPod isn't a good choice, but it's also not the only player in the game. Archos comes to mind; you can put the Opera mobile browser on it.

It is true that it is not the only player in the game. Your idea is not a bad one because people may not know what those other things are...and because of their ignorance, they will not fight the idea as much.
