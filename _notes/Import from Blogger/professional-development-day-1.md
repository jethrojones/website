This was a really good experience for me to direct Professional Development. It was hard to get everything organized, but it was really worthwhile.  
  
In the morning, we did some math stuff. Some teachers talked for just about 30 minutes, and then let the teachers "collaborate" for the remaining three hours. I say "collaborate" because the only teams that were really using that time effectively were those that had one teacher that went to the math conference where they learned about that stuff.  
  
That is frustrating. I did ask them to stay there, and they did all stay there, but that doesn't mean that they were doing what they were supposed to. How would I handle this as a principal in my own school? The only thing I can think of is to make them turn something in at the end of the three hours. I should have thought of that before today, and made sure that it was understood that they needed to complete something tangible by the end. That would have made it much better.  
  
Mrs. P. wanted the juice on the afternoon meeting we had about Think Time and behavior and discipline. Sadly, not much juice happened because it was mostly a presentation, and not a discussion. That is too bad. I had hoped it would be full of good stuff. I recorded it for Mrs. P., but she probably won't care to listen to it. If I weren't sick the other day, I could have talked to the presenter about it when he was there, and then I would have been able to communicate some things to him. Oh, well. Moral of the story: don't get sick, ever!  
  
Have a Good Life.
