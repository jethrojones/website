Best of luck with your team members. If I can help in the quest, please let me know.

So, I'll tell you the truth. Wikis are tough with a small community. I put together a good size wiki at my last company (1300 pages when I left) and it was like pulling teeth. The biggest problem is that a wiki isn't where information _is_; it's a great place for storing information, but usually the information I want to store/share is no where near the wiki.  
  
So, if I want to add something to the wiki I have to:  
1) Remember that a wiki exists  
2) Get past the fear of 'is this important enough to share?'.  
3) Go post the information  
  
And, the worst part, remember to update.  
  
The truth is, from a learning point of view, there are a lot of skills that are pre-requisite for a wiki. For example, a wiki user needs greater understanding of a web page than your common web user. "But!" you say, "I have a wiki with a wysiwyg editor, it's just like Word!" That's great, but the power of a wiki isn't in the words and sentences and paragraphs. The real power of the wiki is links, just like the web at large. And although we all click them, you have to know that information exists and 'think' in a web page state of mind to create links. This is usually a new skill for people that takes practice (like a motor skill; so coaching is often necessary).  
  
So, although I commend your desire to start a wiki, it's not an entry level technology. For example of entry level, look at what Facebook does and Digg.com. I would love to see a 'digg-like' website for educators (maybe built with [Pligg](http://www.pligg.com)?), but I haven't found one yet with a good community.  
  
Anyway, I have a lot more thoughts on this, (if you care to discuss) but I need to go get my blog back up so I can respond properly and not in your comments. :-)

Darren, thanks for your support. I am glad that we connected through Twitter, and I hope I can find a way to have you help me.  
  
Chris, thanks for your well-stated point. I agree that it is not entry level, but I feel that it is the most practical for our purposes. What do you suggest would be better? I am not against changing my mind based on better advice.

Hi Jethro,  
  
Thanks for the mention. As you and many of the comments on my original post suggest, my plan was too ambitious. In our district this year, we are getting people into just two resources - wikis and del.icio.us - through PLCs.  
  
Keep up the good work!  
  
Doug

Doug,  
  
Thank you for your great blog. Your good example of responding to each commenter has inspired me to respond to comments as well, so thanks for that also.

@ Doug  
  
[Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) is a great way to get people to share information; it's easy ant the model makes sense. With a small team I work with, we had success with Google Notebook.  
  
Also, I'm sorry if my earlier comment seemed harsh (I'm not mean, just excited :-), but I think people forget the intimidation factor of a wiki. Sure, we all use wikipedia, but how many of us actively posting/editing wikipedia?  
  
There is a very true learning curve separating the general participation and active use of a wiki. I think there are a lot better services for small groups to use for collaboration; a lot mentioned here (del.icio.us, Google Notebook, [Zoho](http://www.zoho.com), etc.)
