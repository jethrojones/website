I seem to have to relearn certain lessons about digital text every few months. (Which begs the question, 'did I really learn anything in the first place?)  
  
It hurts to know/realize that our words can hurt others, and that we sometimes have to 'bite our digital tongues' and not blog about whatever we want.  
  
I want 'my' blog to be 'my personal learning space' where I do whatever the H-E-double-hockey-sticks I feel like. But the reality is that it is a public space, and in a way, I'm a public official, something I am forced think about more often after moving from teacher to VP... I'm thinking about this right now with my hock-sticks comment above:-/

That's too bad. I understand completely why. I'm given access to some pretty exciting information at my work that I'd love to share, but I can't. It would really affect our business.  
  
Thank you for posting what you did. I really enjoyed having this view into your internship. I'm glad I got to read it as it came out.  
  
Have you thought about a private Ning community (or something like it) where you could invite certain people? That might be a fun forum for those of use that can't share openly on the web. It might be even something I could participate more in.

Dave,  
  
I do think that it is very difficult to navigate that fine line of "my personal learning space" and "public official." I do believe that it is worth it to walk the fine line. I think it teaches those we teach that it is good to censor yourself sometimes. I had such a good internship experience, and I wish that I could share more of it, and maybe someday I will. I did keep a journal of everything, even though I didn't publish it here.  
  
Chris, a private Ning community is a good idea, but not right now. I do think it would be neat when I am an administrator to be able to share things with other admins and invited people that have special insight.
