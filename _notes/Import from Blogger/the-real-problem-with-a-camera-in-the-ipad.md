Almost as soon as the iPad was announced, sans camera, [rumors](http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100210/apple-job-posting-hints-at-ipad-camera/) [started](http://blogs.zdnet.com/digitalcameras/?p=2675) springing up that there would in fact be a [camera](http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/02/apple-ipad-rumor-roundup-abraham-zapruder-edition/) in the [iPad](http://theappleblog.com/2010/02/02/rumor-has-it-the-ipad-camera/). You see, people really wanted a camera, and they wanted one so bad, they pursued the idea, even without much support.  

  

If Apple does ship the iPad with a camera, the question is, where will the camera be? If it is placed on the back of the device, like the iPhone, then there is no problem; Apple ships the device with the Camera app that is on the iPhone, and they are good to go. However, the problem arises if Apple places the camera on the front of the device, as the most [compelling evidence](http://blog.missionrepair.com/2010/02/01/ipad-camera-rumor-becoming-a-reality-we-think-so/) suggests.

  

I don't think that Apple will ship the device with just the Camera app for iPhone if the camera is on the front. If it is on the front, it will be almost completely for video chat. I can't imagine that Apple would release the iPad with a camera and without a video chat app. They need iChat for iPad. This is why Apple didn't announce a camera at the event last month: iChat isn't ready yet.

  

I bet that iChat is ready for the iPad, but probably not ready for the PC, yet. Since iPad owners are not only Mac owners, it stands to reason that Apple would have to make iChat for the PC, just like they have made iTunes and Safari for PC. It will be interesting to see how Apple utilizes a camera in the iPad.
