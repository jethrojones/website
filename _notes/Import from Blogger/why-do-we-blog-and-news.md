Be sure to hit the SWAT team wiki link above to see how the class is doing. The temporary site for the "website for gratitude" is [here](http://jethrojones.com/gratitude.html). It was designed by my students, and I will let them take the reins on it.  
  
Also, here is a neat little video about blogs. It is so well done and very creative. I love how it doesn't use any screenshots or visit any webpages to teach about blogs. So cool!
