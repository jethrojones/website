You've spent how much on apps?  
  
I just downloaded the WetFish app and it lied about how much I have spent on apps. I know for a fact that I've only spent $4.97 on apps (three total purchases) but WetFish puts me at $12.93. It doesn't know that I'm a cheapskate - especially when it comes to iphone apps - and that I've purchased several apps when they were on sale for free.  
  
Still, interesting ideas about the ipad. Here's to the hope that those apps can also be purchase on the cheap - 'cause $9.99 just idn't gonna cut it for me. :)

I haven't actually spent that much, either. I also bought a lot of apps when they were free. I do know that I have spent way more than $4.97, though. I am impressed that you kept it so low.
