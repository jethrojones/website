This week [Geri Parscale](http://www.solution-tree.com/authors/geri-parscale.html) came to visit us in Kodiak and teach us about PLCs. The teachers walked away energized and excited. On Twitter she is [@ParscaleG](https://twitter.com/parscaleg).

In this episode she talks about PLCs and culture. PLCs are a way of life, not a program, and that is what I have always enjoyed about the PLC approach.
