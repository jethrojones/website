Take that [Chris](http://cjmcqueen.com/blog/post/I-don%27t-know-what-this-means.aspx)!!! Apparently you have to be a genius to [understand what I write](http://www.criticsrant.com/bb/reading_level.aspx). Chris made some good comments about how this could just be randomly generated. I did the Flesch-Kincaid for the first page in Word, and I got some different results. Apparently, I write to the grade that I teach...interesting. Some people might say I act the grade I teach also.
