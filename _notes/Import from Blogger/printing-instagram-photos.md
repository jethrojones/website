My wife takes some pretty cool Instagram pictures. I helped her get them ready to print on 4x6 so that they turn out to be 4x4 pictures. [Print Instagram](http://paperlessprincipal.com/blog/2013/9/4/how-to-resize-instagram-photos-to-print-on-4x6-prints) I did it using Automator, AppleScript, and Hazel.  
  
  
Have a Good Life.
