Okay, I fixed the comment moderating. I didn't know that I set it up that way. Sorry, sheesh!  
  
One of my students suggested that I hide a dollar in the mess, and tell my students that if they find it, they get to keep it. Well, I thought about it and decided that they would probably make a bigger mess. I asked my last class if they would clean it up, and they all did it without complaining. They didn't have a problem. I didn't have to do anything.
