There are a lot of great things about the internet. I really love it. [This little girl](http://twentyfivedays.wordpress.com/) is trying to make a difference. "I can make a difference by..." is the theme for this year's Refections contest, which is put on by PTA's throughout the nation (apparently). She is trying to make a difference by doing small things, but it turning out to be much larger. Check out her [blogroll](http://twentyfivedays.wordpress.com/please-scroll-to-the-bottom-of-this-page-to-view-blogroll/) of people that are helping or at least talking about it. This kind of stuff is fascinating. I will have to brainstorm with my kids tomorrow to see what we can do to win [this really neat prize](http://twentyfivedays.wordpress.com/nasa-give-away-for-classrooms/).
