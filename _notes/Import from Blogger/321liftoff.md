Okay, I am pretty sure that my [new website](http://jethrojones.com/fhms) is ready for takeoff. If you find any errors or something doesn't work, please let me know.  
  
In other news, I [read this blog post](http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/from-scotland-to-stockton-learning-scratch/) a couple days ago, and I love what is going on there. The idea of having a separate learning session for your kids is such a marvelous idea. I would love to be able to do that with my kids. I would love to incorporate some of these ideas into my classroom also. For example, we are reading Freak the Mighty, by Rodman Philbrick, and it would be great to host a Skype call with the author and talk about his motivation for writing the story and how he got his ideas, etc. That would be fabulous.
