My student who taught last week wrote up a little response to what she thought of being a teacher for a day:  
  
Being a teacher is not something that I would become when I grow up. A reason is because it's boring and you don't have fun. Besides, all the "students" ignore you and do whatever they want. It's hard being a teacher because you have to to \[sic\] thing so you can answer the students' questions, even though some questions are dumb, you still should know the answer. Now I know that it's not easy to be a teacher, it is actually pretty hard.  
  
I am glad that she was able to understand something from that experience.
