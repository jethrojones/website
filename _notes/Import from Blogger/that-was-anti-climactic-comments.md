I couldn't agree more with your assessment. I was disappointed in the way things turned out. When I was first given the information, I believed that the focus was going to be on the classroom visit, not a presentation before hand. I guess I don't get how politics works. That said, I wish I could have seen the entire lesson. The part I did see was great and am sure that what happened before had was even better. Hopefully there will be better opportunities coming up.

You guys are still my hero. I remember being put down in front of an old Apple II and guided through some basic programs in 2nd grade. Even though I have had a computer in my home my entire life, this experience changed my life and put my on a path towards technology. I would say my life is better for it.  
  
So, keep up the good work. It takes time to changes minds and opinions, but you'll get there.

I wouldn't feel too bad about the experience if I were you. I think the Senator was very impressed with how well you handled your classroom and the experiences that your students were having. As much as anything, I think he just didn't want to interrupt what you were doing with your students.  
  
I, too, wish I could have seen the whole thing. I checked out the kwl chart and I love it! Keep up the great work, Jethro - and a nap every now and then can't be all bad.
