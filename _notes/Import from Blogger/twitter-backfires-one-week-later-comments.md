I have to pop in and tell you that I am trying to wrote a blog post about one of my lower classes. Your experience keeps popping into my mind and I have changed the wording 100 times and still considering not posting it because of what happened to you. Sometimes I hate blogging because I can't really write about any of my "negative" experiences involving anyone at school, or any of the "challenges" I have with students...it forces me into some kind of generic change the names, situations, and details to protect the innocent.

Paul, I have a lot of those blog posts saved as drafts. I use my blog for reflection, and it makes it hard when those things that I really need to reflect on are unpostable because of the feelings of others. It is frustrating, but probably good to censor yourself at times to, as you said, protect the innocent. Those blog posts about the negative things might be the best topics to actually blog about. I think that it would be good to save those posts for a few months, years, decades and then post them.
