I recently got a new iPod Nano for my birthday/[eating-tons-of-cabbage-soup](http://lifeandtimesofstaciandjethro.blogspot.com/2007/10/miracle-super-wonderful-totally-amazing.html) celebration. It came with a game called iQuiz. The really neat thing about that game is that you can [make your own quizzes](http://www.iquizmaker.com/), and it is very easy (or more [complex](http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/games/iquiz.html), if you are interested in that kind of stuff). So, for our weekly department meetings we had to come up with pre/post assessment. The theory behind this is that we give the same test twice. We give it to them once at the beginning of the quarter, and then again at the end. This is supposed to show us how much they have improved. I am not sure I am sold on this whole idea, yet, but we will give it a shot. The iPod story comes into play because we have finished our assessment for 2nd quarter and are ready to administer it. I made a quiz (pictured above, download the txt file [here](http://jethrojones.com/demo/trivia.txt), or in the sidebar to the right, at the top) for the assessment we are giving and I think that the kids will actually want to take the practice quiz because it is offered in a different format. It will help them to do well on the test, also. I think I might make a quiz to help them practice for the CRTs (state tests that are associated with NCLB) also. I remember when Apple announced that game, and I immediately thought of doing something like this.  
  
This would work well for the students because many of my students have iPods. The only problem is that I am sure that many of them do not have the most recent iPods, the ones that you can play these games on. But, if they download the iQuiz maker (or we download them on the school computers) they can practice inside that program. There are still a few kinks to work out, but it would be really cool if this could work.  
  
To see if your iPod will work with this game, go to [this website](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61688#ipodfifth2) and scroll up. The iPods above where the link takes you will work (with the only exception being the iPod Touch). ![](file:///Users/jjones/Desktop/Picture%204.png)
