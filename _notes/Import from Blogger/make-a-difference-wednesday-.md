I mentioned [this website earlier](http://twentyfivedays.wordpress.com/) and wanted to mention it again. My class has gone to great lengths to set the day aside to help raise rice for the United Nations. They wrote a proposal to the administration, they planned out a schedule, made permission slips to teachers, and passes back from the library. I am so proud of how hard they worked. So, a lot of students will be filtering into the library to go to [Freerice.com](http://freerice.com/) and see how much rice we can to donate to the United Nations. The totals for the past few days are in the image below.

If you have a chance, please spend a couple minutes there and pad our stats. ;)  
  
My students would really appreciate your help.  
  
In other news. The [SWAT team wiki](http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/) is up and running. It looks great. The students have done almost all of that all by themselves. They are doing a remarkable job! Stay posted for the website for gratitude if we can ever figure out how to get the form to work.
