I'm no doctor, but life experience has taught me this much, at least:  
  
1\. Spend the night outside when it is cold.  
2\. Make sure it is rainy, too.  
3\. Sleep poorly.  
4\. Get in line with 44,999 of your closest friends (many of whom also spent the night outside).  
5\. Huddle in a small enclosed space with live flu strains floating around.  
  
"People started arriving as early as Friday night to get into line -- bringing food, blankets and umbrellas. Some arrived around 6 a.m. -- an hour before the clinics opened -- only to learn they were too late."
