I realize that I am no James Earl Jones, but since we share a last name, I figure I should pay homage to his narration skills as I introduce my first real video series on teaching. The YouTube playlist is a 15-part series on how I teach my students to write a persuasive essay. It clocks in at 51 minutes, 11 seconds (much thanks to the people at the [time math calculator](http://www.csgnetwork.com/timeconv.html) for making that surprisingly difficult task of adding up all the segments a very easy thing to do).

  

I certainly don't expect anyone to watch the entire series; I mainly made them for my students to use who were absent. The neat thing is that I have about a week's worth of lessons completely ready for next year.Â 

  

It is pretty fun to do this kind of stuff, and I love teaching this lesson to my students. I like most what happens after the lesson. I love to see them improve their writing so much in so short a time.
