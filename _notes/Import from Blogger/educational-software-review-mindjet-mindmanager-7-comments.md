Hi Mr. Jones,  
  
One thing that works handily to let you place topics anywhere you like is to hold down the Shift key while dragging and dropping. Otherwise, it does try to attach to nearby topics, as you pointed out.

Man, I love MindManager 7.0. It really comes in handy when you want to use your mind map as a project plan or if you want to turn it into a document.  
At my last job, I wrote in XML, and I have really missed the power of removing content from a linear form. So, lately, I've written the outline for a document or assignment in Mindmanager and then fleshed out the document using the Notes feature, and then published to Word, where I cleaned up the rest.  
  
So, I would give MindManager another try. The power it has in planning and document creation can be really helpful.
