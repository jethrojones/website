I just finished putting the finishing touches on my [presentation page](http://jethrojones.com/UCET2009/) for the [UCET 2009](http://www.ucet.org) conference.  
  
Friday and Saturday, I will be presenting about the iPod Touch in the Language Arts 7 classroom. I hope the presentation goes over well. The plan is to let people experiment with the iPods and ask questions. I hope that it works out well and people are not bored to tears. That would stink!  
  
Take a look at the page and feel free to tell me what you think.  
  
Have a Good Life.
