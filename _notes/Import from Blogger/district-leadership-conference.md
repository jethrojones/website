We attended an all-principals meeting today, and it was huge.  
  
They fed us all sorts of information. There is so much that you need to learn about as a principal. It is not just teachers and curriculum. Although, that is (at least it seems to me) what they want you to focus on the most.  
  
They revealed their performance-based compensation plan today, and it is not a very fair system. They kept warning us that it would not be fair by saying, "There is no performance-based system that is fair and equitable, but it is nice to get something rather than nothing--It is a nice bonus." It was a line. That is not really how it is. It could be more fair, if they would work out some of the major kinks. The problem is that if someone goes from one school to another, they are paid for how their 08-09 school performs, even if they put in (or didn't put in) a lot of work at their 07-08 school, which will be used to tabulate the bonuses. So, teachers (administrators and staff) can get bigger bonuses than they deserve if they go to a school that does better. On the other hand, staff that goes from a good school to one that performs less well, will get paid less because their school stinks. That is pretty frustrating. The worst thing about this plan, though is the original concept. They are going to have to spend more money creating, administering and implementing the plan than they need to. It has to be a complex system to give everyone an equal chance of getting it, and it has to be complex to make sure that everyone gets what they deserve. That has to happen. It is a hard plan, and that makes things very complicated.
