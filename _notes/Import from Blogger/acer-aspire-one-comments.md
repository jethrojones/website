i purchased my acer aspire from the shopping channel!  
it was so amazing how this small laptop stands alone and does everything your pc does. the only thing i find as a drawback is the fact that there isn't a cd/dvd drive. i would like to edit videos froom my jvc everio camcorder and in order to do so, i have to buy an external cd/dvd drive... i wish i had thought about a 30 day pre-trial, thats damn near a steal of a price! i highly recomend this acer aspire one, its a great laptop to have!

Just so you know, the 'processor speed' you refer to isn't the whole story. That Dell you refer to probably has a Pentium M (like my 4-year-old HP dv1000) in it, which at 1.6 GHz is actually faster than the little Atom in the Acer.  
  
That said, I'm typing this comment on my own Acer Aspire One, and have no complaints about the speed.  
  
Oh, and I think you could go up to 1.5 GB of memory, but not more, as I don't think it'll take more than a 1 GB stick in its only free slot.  
  
Take care!
