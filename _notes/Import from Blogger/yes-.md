I love the semi-colon! This rocks! Though, I don't know if this really makes much sense.  
  
  

  
  
**You Are a Semi-Colon**  

  

![](http://www.blogthingsimages.com/whatpunctuationmarkareyouquiz/semicolon.gif)

  
  
You are elegant, understated, and subtle in your communication.  
  
You're very smart (and you know it), but you don't often showcase your brilliance.  
  
  
  
Instead, you carefully construct your arguments, ideas, and theories â€“ until they are bulletproof.  
  
You see your words as an expression of yourself, and you are careful not to waste them.  
  
  
  
You friends see you as enlightened, logical, and shrewd.  
  
(But what you're saying often goes right over their heads.)  
  
  
  
You excel in: The Arts  
  
  
  
You get along best with: The Colon
