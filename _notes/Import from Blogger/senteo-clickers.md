I use iClickers in my Politics class down at BYU, and it they are pretty nice. Last week I learned about [SmartTechnology's Senteo](http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/Products/Senteo/default.htm) system which is pretty neat. The video below will give you a taste of it.  
  
    
  
The nice thing about it that there are so many possibilities with it. Here is a [video](http://www.screencast.com/users/jethro/folders/Jing/media/f0ec54cb-a635-4e65-a3a2-975c08e77371) of the action with my students participating. So, here is the neat thing: at our school, we are supposed to give assessments and analyze the data. They want us to do really in-depth data analysis. This spreadsheet shows what Senteo exports. This is great because if you make these lists (which I am not sure how to do) you can show only those who missed certain questions, or those who got certain questions right. It is really neat.  
  
  
  
With these spreadsheets, you can see how well you teach certain topics, see how you need to improve, see if a question is throwing everybody off. You can also find students that are doing really poorly, and figure out how to differentiate instruction for them.  
  
Have a Good Life.
