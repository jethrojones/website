Sandra is a great principal at Sandy Elementary. She has received numerous awards in her 7 years as an administrator:

*   Community Leader of the Year 
*   Rookie of the Year 
*   Distinguished Principal of the Year 
*   CITES Recognition 
*   National Board Certified Teacher

And, she is pretty much always being praised and recognized by her peers. I am fortunate to be able to work with her.

[Here is Sandy’s web site](http://sandy.canyonsdistrict.org) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SandyElementary).

Big Goals: Wants to make people feel like they are at home-that her school is a family. Wants to be with the children as much as possible. Wants to provide a holistic education, especially to her disadvantaged students.

It is interesting to hear that she strives to really know her students, but is ok with not knowing every student’s name. I find this fascinating. In the last episode, Dr. Villar was very focused on knowing every student’s name. I don’t know that either way is the best method, but I do believe that their intent is the same. They both want their students to know that they are cared for and feel safe. That is what matters.
