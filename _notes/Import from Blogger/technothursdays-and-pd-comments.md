Hey J,  
  
I agree with your close. My mantra this year, the fruit of fruitless evangelizing in PD workshops, is similar to what you say: "Without a need, a tool is useless." Most teachers (and students) don't feel the _need_ for this stuff. Until they do, they're not going to want to spend energy figuring it out.  
  
Be there when they Need tech, and give them the tool? You're golden then.
