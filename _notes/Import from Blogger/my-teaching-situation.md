Well, it turns out that I will have a job next year. My school is overstaffed, and I will be moving to [Fort Herriman Middle School](http://www.jordandistrict.org/schools/middle/fortherriman/index.htm). My principal thinks that I will like it there, although she wishes that I could stay at my current school. It has some neat technology bonuses that go along with it. I hope that I will be able to incorporate the technology in a good way. I am pretty excited about it. My principal did say that if there is another opening at my school, she is going to be very angry if I still go to Fort Herriman. It is nice to be appreciated, I must admit that.
