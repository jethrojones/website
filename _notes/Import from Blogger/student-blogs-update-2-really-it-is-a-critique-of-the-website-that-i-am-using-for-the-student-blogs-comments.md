Hi Jethro,  
Sorry that I haven't read your blog post earlier. I apologize if you had problems contacting customer support. We usually respond within a couple of hours. Also, you can always downgrade to the free package, though I admit the navigation isn't self-explanatory for downgrading. Yet an e-mail to our customer service should have fixed this shortly.  
We definitely take your comments seriously, and will consider it for our future development.  
Best,  
Leif
