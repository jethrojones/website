_Download your random quotes here: [http://is.gd/3dFC4h](http://is.gd/3dFC4h) #summerblog_  
  
As I mentioned in my post yesterday about the [Random Quote for Email SignaturesÂ ](http://mrjonesed.blogspot.com/2012/07/random-quote-for-email-sigs.html), I have a lot of quotes that I have collected from various places over the years. Many of them came from [LeadershipFreak](http://leadershipfreak.wordpress.com/) on Twitter. And many came from sources that I can't remember now.  
  
If you would like to try it out for yourself, read the post from yesterday, and then feel free to use the TextExpander folder that I created from my list of quotes. Leave your great quotes in the comments. I'll add them to it.  
  
Have a Good Life.
