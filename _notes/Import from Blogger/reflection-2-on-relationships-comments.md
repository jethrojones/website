I have so many things to say; I don’t know where to start. First of all, it’s very tempting to stay in your classroom, but you need to spend time away from it. I know this is true when I start calling my classroom, my house. “It’s in my house;” “Come back to my house with me;” etc. You may laugh, but it’s a common slip of the tongue for me. Second, I feel bad you felt left out. Although, I never thought our school had cliques, the more I think of it, it does. That’s something for me to work on next year – being more inclusive. As for talking about students, that’s the nature of faculty rooms. Complaining goes on, but teachers also praise them and discuss exciting things that are going on in their classrooms. I wish you could have seen more of this. Finally, although you didn’t feel part of the faculty, you were. Not only do teachers discuss students, but we also discuss other teachers. We had heard positive things about you and your classroom and we were sad to hear you were leaving. In fact, we spent an entire lunch contemplating why Brenda was offered James’s position and you weren’t. I bet you had no idea we talked about you so much – I hope that doesn’t reinforce any negative thoughts about faculty rooms. Anyways, I appreciated all the great ideas you gave me and look forward to reading about all the great things you'll do at Fort Herriman.

Mandy,  
  
Thanks for your input. As I stated above, feeling left out was more my problem than others. Once I started talking to you, and others, I realized that you were all very friendly. I think it was my own insecurities more than the rudeness of others. Thanks for your support.
