Wow, Jethro, you are right. That is a great video. I really really liked it. Just watching that video opened up a whole realm of possibilities for learning for students. Think of how awesome it would be to have a podcast of your lectures and the kids can listen to it before your class, then get to the class and ask questions!!  
  
Being a teacher, that has been my chief complaint, not enough questions! Although, I imagine being able to ask a question every 10 hours would be suffocating to a student.  
  
This video is very progressive. He brought out so many things that I never even thought of. This can take primary education to a whole new level. Now the trick is TEACHING all the old-school, entrenched, luddites who still refuse to acknowledge technology as a tool and not a nuisance.
