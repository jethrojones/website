[Here](http://www.newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/beloved-church-president-gordon-b-hinckley-dies-at-97) are [the](http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/01/27/obit.hinckley/index.html) [links](http://www.foxnews.com/urgent_queue/index.html#128a932a,2008-01-27). I saw [President](http://mormon.org) [Hinckley](http://lds.org) speak a few times. I ran the teleprompter for him once at [BYU-Idaho](http://www.byui.edu). Other than that, I haven't had any personal contact with him. I do know this, though: Gordon B. Hinckley was a prophet of God, just like Moses, Adam, Noah, Peter, Nephi, Lehi, Mormon, and all the other holy prophets in the scriptures.  
  
Have a good life.
