In re commenting user experience, it's a litle bit funny that when I click on the "post a comment link" on your page, I get a tiny pop-up window (in FF1.5) for the comment entry, which is too small to see the content in it, is not resizeable, and has no scrollbars!

Steve, Boy, do I feel sheepish! Baaaaah (from Aladdin). I get it in a pop up window as well, but it does have scrollbars in FF 2.0. Well, not anymore. I disabled the "open comments in a pop-up window" option in Blogger. Hopefully, if you respond to this comment, your commenting experience will be better. ;)  
Have a Good Life.
