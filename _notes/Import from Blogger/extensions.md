This is not exactly educational, but it is very interesting, and other people have [mentioned it before](http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/from-scotland-to-stockton-learning-scratch/). When my daughter was born yesterday (yippee!!!), I called my dad on Skype to tell him she came safely and show him what she looks like. He lives in Brazil, and so it is not easy to call and talk to him very often without [Skype](http://www.skype.com). Think of how amazing Skype could be in education. If I wanted to talk to an author, or a professional, or an actor, or a screenwriter, or anyone else associated with the subject that I teach, it would be very easy to do. Wednesday night I did not go to class because Staci was going in for the C-section on Thursday, but it turns out that I was sick, too. I emailed my professor and asked if we could do a Skype call, but he didn't know what it was so he would have to set it up. Turns out, he couldn't get it to work. Bummer, it would have been really neat to be able to attend my class while sitting at home.  
  
I would really like to do a video call with someone in a profession that could benefit my English students. I do know an author, named [Stacey Cochran](http://www.staceycochran.com), and maybe I could contact him and do something. I will have to try that.
