Literal words. When you are a principal ( or have any position of authority, supposed or otherwise) what you say really means something, even if you don't mean for it to. You have to remember that when you make flippant comments and when you say anything. You need to cut down on the jokes until people begin to tell when you are joking.  
  
Today we got to go with some new teachers. Mrs P took a class and I walked around wig the teAcher and them I took a class and she walked around with another teacher. We focused on classroom management and looked at some teachers who do a really good job.  
  
One other thing I have noticed is that some teachers talk to me more than Mrs P. That is, when they ask a question that she might only know thy look at me instead of her. I wonder why that is! Although I bet if I were to ask them, they probably wouldn't even know that they had done it. It would be interesting to know, though.
