Jethro, this is a very enjoyable post about learning styles and how you accommodate them. I liked the way you compared teaching adults vs kids. Do you really find that much difference in ages, or do you think it is more personal?  
  
I teach mostly adults and have found a huge variety within this population. It is true that many must go step-by-step, but there are those who love to mess around in the programs. (I am teaching the Adobe Creative Suite 4 programs-Flash, Illustrator, InDesign).  
  
RE Twitter--I have also learned so much from Twitter and blogs, but find Twitter more difficult to manage. Any hints on how to do this? Blogs are easy since the aggregator organizes everything for me. Oh well not to worry, because as information and the tools explode, companies come along with innovative ways to manage it.

Lynda, I think that learning is very personal, but I also think that there is something to this idea about how we learn based on the generation we are from. It makes sense that you would find a great variety in the "adult population" as it possibly spans at least 40 years (18-60 year-olds). A quick [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=learning%20styles%20among%20generations) shows that there is support for this idea out there.  
  
Twitter is difficult to manage, and when I started following about 200 people, I realized that I could spend all day reading twitter. I found a neat application called [DestroyTwitter](https://destroytwitter.com/) which allows you to change the preferences so that you can follow only certain people in that client. It reduces the immense amount of "stuff." Try using that and just follow a few people that you actually want to keep up with (like me, I just added you).
