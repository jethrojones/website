Jethro,  
Right now your biggest problem probably wouldn't be a grant, it would be getting permission to order them from the district. iPods have not been determined by district admins to have educational value at this point. We have argued this for nearly two year.

KD, You are probably right. At our school, iPods are completely banned. The way I see it, this would be almost equivalent to getting desktops or laptops for the classrooms, only cheaper. Sure, there are other things that make that an unequal comparison, but it is still pretty close. Most of the teachers don't even understand the available software on the laptops, so most of the money on those computers is in a large part wasted. How can I get them to let me try it out and see if it there is an educational value?  
  
That is what I want to do. If it does have educational value, it is much cheaper than computers for everyone. If it doesn't have educational value, then we blew 10K, like that has never happened. ;)

Another issue you might run into is daisy chaining USB hubs together. Now, I haven't even come close to trying this but I've read that it doesn't work. Plus, it looks like there is a limit on how many you can connect to iTunes and one time. Just some things to look into.

Hi,  
I'm starting a pilot with a K-12 district this Fall. Participating teachers (5 total) will each receive a classroom set of 28 ipods (8g ipod touch). The primary focus is language arts, but other content areas will participate as well. I've started a wiki to help others - http://ipodclassroom.wikispaces.com
