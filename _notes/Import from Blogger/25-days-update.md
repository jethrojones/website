Well, my students discussed, brainstormed, and came up with some great ideas for how to make a difference.  
  
One girl, the resident genius, suggested what I think is the best idea. She wants to make a website for gratitude. People will be able to go to the website and type in a message of gratitude to someone. The web form will then email that message to the recipient. I think it is a great idea. Hopefully, it will work.  
  
The next idea was to do something with [Freerice.com](http://freerice.com/). After talking about it, we decided we would try to have the library full all day with shifts of students trying to raise rice for the United Nations. I think it will work really well, but we might not have enough time.  
  
The last idea is one that I came up with, but it will still help. I gave the kids the idea, but they have done most of the work so far. They are making a [SWAT team wiki](http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/). It will be a place that students can go to for information and tutoring. It is a big project, also. We will be working on this all year. I am very excited about it. I did blogs with my students last year, and I think this will be a good thing to do.
