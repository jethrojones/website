I can't believe that I have been at my new job for a month already. Time has flown by! 

  

I really love it here at Kodiak Middle School. The teachers are great. The kids are great. It is a lot of fun. And having fun is what makes it all worth it. 

  

So, what has been occupying my time for the last month? 

  

I've met with nearly all the teachers and asked them what they would like to start stop and continue at our school. Their answers have been revealing and interesting. I feel that the teachers have been honest and forthright. They are taking this opportunity of a new principal as a way to improve themselves. Since we don't know each other we are able to start fresh and let our best qualities be the qualities that define us. That is super exciting, don't you think? 

  

School started. We had a great day of building inservice. We created norms for our faculty meetings. I've done that process many times with many groups and it never ceases to amaze me how unique it is every time. We took about 3 hours to complete that process. That is a long time, but at least that process didn't span multiple meetings. The feedback from the teachers was very valuable as well. Many admitted it was a long time, but almost all agreed that the time investment was worth it.
