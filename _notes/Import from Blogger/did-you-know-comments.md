very interesting. I can remember when you were about 2 I built a computer that had a five inch screen and a whopping 16k of ram. we have come a long way in very little time. I feel so out of touch with computers even though I use them each day. I love you.

There is another presentation that you may be interested in by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills. I posted the lecture and the PowerPoint on my blog, www.information-age-education.com.

Did you know according to the department of uneducated, misinformed idiots, that this video will be watched by way too many people, which is how many people have AIDS in the world. Also, the US Federal Government spent $6 Million on Grant Joint Union High School District in 2002, $4 M in 2001, and $8 M in 2003. And what year did the US Federal Government spend less than $70M on research and innovation in education? What qualifies as such? What counts in Nintendo's Research and Innovation? Marketing? Advertising for their new consoles, research as to which color is most appealing to users? Food for employees, health benefits for R & D employees? Come on! As the video goes on, the claims get more ridiculous. Yes, cutting edge, new technology and information is being created every day. But how much of that is taught to kids in school!?!?!? In school you learn FUNDAMENTAL principles that are never outdated. I don't know, maybe this dude is right, I remember learning Calculus in my first year of college and it being totally outdated two years later. In fact when I took another Calculus class 6 years later, they used the same book. I don't know how they got away with that. History, what a dynamic, ever changing subject. When I learned about the American Revolution 10 years ago, I don't know what they were thinking! Didn't they know that all that has changed by now. Our first president is named G-double-dizzle. Math, History, English, Economics, Accounting, Literature, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computers, Foreign Language, Art, Art History have all so radically changed so much in the last 2 years. Even Computer programming languages, which have changed a great deal over the last few years, are still being taught the same languages that were taught 15 years ago. And what is tripling every 6 months? The amount of data created? The throughput of fiber transmission? I thought data was going to double every 72 hours in just 3 years. How could it only be tripling every sixth months for the next 20 years? Trust me on this one, the marginal costs of upgrading a full switch infrastructure are NOT marginal, nor are they anywhere close to 0. In fact, the upgrades are often put off because the savings from the speed increases are not high enough to offset the cost of the upgrades for 5-8 years! They are just improving the switches on the ends, that is all. It only costs $12,000 for 1 switch that is 1/1000th the speed of this 10 Terabit switch. I guarantee you that a switch of that speed would cost Millions of dollars, so effectively six 0's. A supercomputer that can exceed the computation capability of something that we don't even understand 10% of, let alone utilize? How can we say that we can create something that can exceed the capability of something that we have never even seen that capability of?

Sorry, dude, I know what you were going for with this, but these kind of videos with gross inaccuracies and the kind of "Forward to everyone you know" mentality really bugs me.
