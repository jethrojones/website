For a long time, I have wanted to write a book. I didn't know if one would ever get published or not, but I have wanted to write a book. I didn't care if it was fiction or nonfiction, but I knew that I wanted to a have a book with my name as the author. If you've been reading this blog for a while, you're probably crazy! But, you may also be my parents.  
  
In 2008, I even started blogging about my experiences as an intern with the intent to turn that into a small book (really a journal). My cooperating principal didn't think that was a good idea, so I scrapped that idea (though I still have 30 blog post drafts waiting to be published).  
  
In 2002, I came up with the opening line for the fictional work that I will someday write. It is....Well, I'll save it for later. I haven't forgotten it, and I don't think I will.  
  
It has finally happened. I am finalizing a [book](http://paperlessprincipal.com/). I have been staying up late at night for the last few weeks trying to get it done in time. Some days it is easier than others to write, but every day it is rewarding.  
  
The book is called "Paperless Principal" and you can preorder it here: [http://paperlessprincipal.com](http://paperlessprincipal.com/).  
  
It was inspired by David Sparks' [Paperless](http://macsparky.com/paperless), which I bought earlier this year. Since I bought _that_ book, I have been staying up late at night organizing a paperless system for our office at work. I spent hours creating those workflows, and realized that I was making it a lot harder than it needed to be. Since we are still so reliant on paper, the goal of a paperless office eludes many of us. It is possible however, to have a mostly paperless office. And I show principals how to do that in my book.  
  
It includes screenshots, screencasts, and a lot of instructions. In the preorder, I include the automation tools that I have talked about in the [Paperless Principals](http://mrjonesed.blogspot.com/search/label/paperless) posts on this blog. I am also offering a 30 minute Skype/FaceTime/Phone consult to help get people started.  
  
I think it is pretty good. I think you might, too, especially if you are a principal interested in a paperless office. Go support your indie author and [buy it](http://paperlessprincipal.com/preorder).  
  
Have a Good Life.
