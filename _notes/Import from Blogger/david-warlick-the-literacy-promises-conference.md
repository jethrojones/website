This page acts as my notes for his presentation, so please excuse any poor wording or bad grammar.  
  
I am amazed at how connected David Warlick tries to make his presentations. We can [edit his handouts](http://davidwarlick.com/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.RedefiningLiteracyForThe21stCentury) (passy: teacher), be involved in a [live chat](http://davidwarlick.com/ajaxchat/index.php) during his presentation (he invites us to pass notes while he is talking), and access his [outline](http://davidwarlick.com/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.OutlineForRLPresentation) also. Here is a pretty cool [presentation](http://issuu.com/davidwarlick/docs/contemporary_literacy/7) of his...uh...presentation  
  
Taking a cellphone to the grocery store is the new grocery list.  
  
We need to teach literacy, and not technology.  
  
URL backtracing - delete up to the last / and it will hopefully direct you to a parent webpage. He did a neat example showing that the publisher of a Martin Luther King Jr. website was actually a white supremacist group. This is an important thing to teach our kids. It is good for evaluating our sources.  
  
He just use earthquake data to make a map of the world...Amazing. I need to learn how to do that. [ANSS](http://neic.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/epic/epic.cgi?SEARCHMETHOD=1&FILEFORMAT=4&SEARCHRANGE=HH&SYEAR=2004&SMONTH=12&SDAY=01&EYEAR=2005&EMONTH=1&EDAY=1&LMAG=3&UMAG=9.9&NDEP1=&NDEP2=&IO1=&IO2=&SLAT2=0.0&SLAT1=0.0&SLON2=0.0&SLON1=0.0&CLAT=0.0&CLON=0.0&CRAD=0&SUBMIT=Submit+Search) data from 12/1/4 to 12/31/4 importing it into Excel and then making a scatterplot. It was very cool.  
  
Lulu.com is where he published his books. 1 hour after it was written, it was available for purchase. The site asks how much you want to make on the book, and then it gets it all ready and prints it on demand. This would be a great way to create a book written by students. So cool.  
  
Great presentation. I am glad I stayed for it.  
  
Have a Good Life.
