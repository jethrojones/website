I got another job again. This one is better than delivering donuts (which I did last fall). I am the newest member of the gang at [The Apple Blog](http://theappleblog.com/). I will be writing articles that relate to Apple products. If you subscribe or visit this blog often, please consider visiting and/or subscribing to that blog. I will try to give an educational slant to most of my articles over there.

My first article over there is about [TubeTV](http://theappleblog.com/2008/03/19/tubetv-a-handy-little-app-for-saving-your-videos/)\--a program that downloads and converts online videos for iPod, iPhone, and AppleTV. I really like that program and I use it all the time. It is especially useful for teachers.  
  
Thanks for supporting me here (and there), and don't worry, I will continue this blog.
