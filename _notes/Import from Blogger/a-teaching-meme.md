I am following the lead of an [edublogger](http://deeperwater.com/2007/11/04/a-teaching-meme/) that I just learned about. I don't know any of the teachers' blogs that I read, and I only know one of the bloggers that is a teacher.  
  

**1\. I am a good teacher because…** I love learning and helping other people learn.  

**2\. If I weren’t a teacher, I would be…** lost! All through my life I have wanted to be a teacher. I tried to avoid it, but I knew I would end up in education. I believe any job in education is there to help students learn.  

**3\. My teaching style is…** dependent on my students, but sadly probably more authoritative than I would like.  

**4\. My classroom is…** covered in paper. I have papers all over my desk and counter top. My organization skills are in desperate need of assistance from a professional organizer.  

**5\. My lesson plans…** are [online.](http://jethrojones.com/fhms/planbook/Language%20Arts%207/index.html)  

**6\. One of my teaching goals is…** to start my own school (that goal is still many years away from being accomplished.)  

**7\. The toughest part of teaching is…** motivating the unmotivated, (I agree with Blair).  

**8\. The thing I love most about teaching is…** when students "get it". The "Oh, I get it now!" is the best and most exciting thing to hear.  

**9\. A common misconception about teaching is…** those who can't do, teach. (And by extension, those who can't teach, teach PE.)  

**10\. The most important thing I’ve learned since I started teaching…** It takes time to be a good teacher. Teaching is a marathon, not a sprint.
