Interesting, so who got to clean up this mess? You? How fun was that? Was it worth spending your whole prep period picking up all your stuff, just to get through to one STUDENT!?!? I hope so...I could never do this. I could never willingly make that mess. It would make me have a nervous breakdown.

That is so cool! I bet it was fun to throw papers all over. I have always wanted to do that. I bet cleaning it up wasn't so fun.
