I've never taught in the public school, but something that I've noticed is that Teachers seem to forget that students are clients. In the business world and the instructional design world the person you give your service to is the client--the customer; and the customer is always right, right? ;-)  
  
I guess it's easy to forget that the people we serve are the ones having to deal with us. This is especially hard when students are forced to go to school. Students **have** to be there, teachers **have** to make sure students learn; the whole thing is messed up. It's the stupidest business model every constructed (except, maybe, for social security).  
  
So, I know you think you're doing right by telling the class they're the 'worst', but if you think about it, would you want your waiter to tell you you're the worst table he's had that day? On the other hand, is this a serious enough issue to apologize for? I don't know; but I would be surprised if my son's teach said his class was the 'worst'.  
  
And, just as a note, I've put my foot in my mouth a lot worse than this, so I'm not judging, I'm only commenting. :-)

Chris, the big fallacy here is that education is a business. It is not. It is an entirely different entity. I know that there are some that think Education is a business, and they won't like this comment. You can't run a school like a business.  
  
I **don't** think that I am doing right by telling them they are the worst. It is a horrible way to manage a classroom and it all started with calling those girls out for cheating. That was a big mistake, and I should not have done that. It undermines everything that I have been working for this year.  
  
I wouldn't care what the waiter said, because I would just not give him a tip. You can't do that in education. We are not paid on the quality of service we provide (isn't that awful?) and so it doesn't matter how mean I (or worse teachers) am.  
  
I have put my foot in my mouth worse than this as well. :)

So, if you don't run a school like a business, how do you run it? This is a very sincere question. What has BYU taught you? What is education administration?

I think the kids responded because you revealed yourself as a person and for some reason, it broke through their consciousness of you as "teacher".  
  
Even though you may have said similar things in class, kids hear "teacher speak" in everything and tend to discount it. It's the same reason they are surprised to see you in the supermarket.

Chris - That is a question to be answered in another post.  
  
Sylvia - Thanks for the great point. I hadn't really thought of it like that, so I appreciate the input. It does make sense, and it may have even worked to my benefit, because good behavior is on the rise, now.

I really appreciate your candidness and honesty. My perspective is not so much that you called them the worst class or lost it with them but of the public nature of your comments.  
  
As Chris, I not judging because I've been guilty of the same but while I might say a lot of things to my family that I'd never say in public and also with and to my colleagues.  
  
To me it's understanding the public nature of the web. I still struggle with this and while not every online conversation is meant for everyone, it is open to everyone.  
  
So my take is I might not apologize for saying it but would apologize for saying it in public.  
  
Just my 2 cents.

I like the point Sylvia made and I think it ties in with what Dean said. You became a person when they saw the public comment, and it hurt because it was public.  
  
My own birth children often drive me CRAZY. They know this. They also know I love them. But if they saw me put a Tweet out that said they were being horrible, it would hurt because it was no longer in the family. Luckily, they're young yet and don't know about Twitter, because I do use it to vent. :)  
  
I'm glad you brought this up. I'm conscious of what I say about my district, my teachers, my admin because I realize the public nature of my feed, but I hadn't thought about being careful about talking about the students.  
  
I think the apology for the public nature of the post might be helpful. And maybe you can be sure to say something positive publicly, even if you're not sure they'll see it.

My thought is that lots of teachers use in class complaints regarding class behavior as an attempt to motivate them. They're often not really the "worst class" but teachers call them that to motivate them to improve. I've had multiple worst classes in one day.  
  
For the students to see that this wasn't a motivational ploy but really how you felt (b/c you didn't even expect them to see it) makes a difference.  
  
My thoughts anyway.

Might it help to make a distinction between them and their behavior, and you and your emotional response? I see a lot of generalizing here from both sides. Surely your students will also read this blog, and all our comments? They should. I would if I were your student. I would be looking for whether you really hate us, whether we can really get to you emotionally, and if so wonder who's out of control here, you or us?  
  
You want them to separate whether you dislike them from your disapproval of their work (at least, from the plagiarism example, I assume that's what you're doing), but are you modelling that? \*They\* are not annoying, but perhaps certain behaviors or their refusal to understand class parameters are. Be specific in your criticism. Explain what you mean by "worst" in terms of standards, not emotions.  
  
I hope I'm not sounding too harsh here.
