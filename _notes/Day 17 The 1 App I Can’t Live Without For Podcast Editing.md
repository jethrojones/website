Today, there is an app, website, or software platform for just about anything (including finding someone to walk your dog).

But when it comes to podcast editing, there is 1 app I can't live without:

Descript 

And here's why:

**Reason #1:**

Edit audio like text. Don't like a word or phrase in your podcast, just delete the words and the audio waveforms go away as well. This is revolutionary, and just this alone saved me hours in editing each week. 

**Reason #2:** 

Automatic filler word removal. This quick tool takes out the ums, uhhs, ahhs, mmhmms, repeated words, and so much more. It's truly like magic. And, it does a good job of taking them out cleanly so you can't even tell it was there in the first place. 

**Reason #3:**

Automatic Transcription. Honestly, this should probably be higher on the list because it enables the first two. But it's awesome to get an automatically transcribed audio file in just a few seconds. I've done over 1,000 podcasts over the last decade, and this feature is so handy. It immediately makes all your recordings searchable! 

**Reason #4:**

Ease of use. As my podcast empire has grown (@bepodcastnet has over 45 shows now!), I've brought on editors and even partnered with a school to help edit certain podcasts to give kids real-world experience. They can pick it up easily. 

**Reason #5:**

Web interface. You can do all the editing in Chrome, so even if you're not at your main computer, you can edit anywhere. This has saved my bacon a few times. 

If you want speed, accuracy, and simplicity in editing your podcast, I can't recommend using this app enough https://get.descript.com/swu3aooczakr
