We had a great time at the [[Big Impact Mixer]] yesterday. You can join us, you know. Just go [here](https://bigimpactmixer.com). 

[Brian Pulliam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briankpulliam/) was our main event and he shared his story of going from making a salary of over 600K as a software engineer lead to working 3-4 hours per day, and that is it! He shared a little bit about why he took this transition, and how rewarding it has been. 
<!--more-->
- Brian shared his career journey through roles at Microsoft, Zillow, and Coinbase before transitioning to a coaching career.
- Emphasized the need for a **low-risk transition**, especially considering his family's financial stability.
- Discussed the concept of **'leap of faith' assumptions** and how they can derail goals if not verified. 
- Brian compared **personal goal achievement** to running a startup, using **scientific experimentation** like A/B testing to optimize outcomes.
- Shared details about his **coaching method**: focused on teaching tactics, allowing clients to run their own experiments.

I shared the three things that I learned in Japan at the beginning of this month
1. Think long term
2. Be intentional
3. Design for the user

**Who is this Jethro guy and why is he hosting this event?** 

I have been podcasting since 2008, in various forms. Since then, I have created the longest running, most downloaded school leadership podcast out there, Transformative Principal. I now help other people who are mission driven to create their own podcasts and connect with the right people in the right way to build powerful communities where people take action.
