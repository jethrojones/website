Last month, we talked about little experiments in our [[Big Impact Mixer]]

Every social media post you make is an experiment. 

But how do you know if they are doing what you want them to do? 

You need to see how they perform. 

For our Big Impact Mixer this month, we have Teacher TikTok creator Aaron Makelky sharing how he analyzes his posts every week. 

You can join us at 10 am Pacific on Thursday. [RSVP Here](https://www.icloud.com/invites/0ab98kwaEjaLaINfEV7n-jYeQ).

See you soon!
