> ChatGPT, it turns out, is a woefully bad way to explore the historical record.

I would say, ChatGPT is woefully bad way to seek truth. But to explore the historical record, it’s actually quite good. 

But just as the beginning days of Wikipedia, you shouldn’t just stop there. It is a great starting point, just like Wikipedia. Trust but verify. See more from [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/dont_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_generative_ai_bullshit_bathwater).

Here's the key point: It is truly confusing to the average person what is real and what isn't. 

That's not just a problem for AI models. It's also a problem for our mainstream media. 

Digital literacy continues to be an urgent need! How do you know what is real and what isn't when you see something online?
