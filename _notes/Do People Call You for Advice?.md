We're always looking for ways to validate that what we are doing is working. 

We conduct surveys, ask for feedback, looking at lagging and leading indicators, submit to performance evaluations. 

These are all fine and dandy, but you have to often judge things by other metrics. 

One way a leader can validate if things are working is if they get called *by peers* for advice. 

Your subordinates asking for advice is not the same thing.
