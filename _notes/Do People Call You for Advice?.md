We're always looking for ways to validate that what we are doing is working. 

We conduct surveys, ask for feedback, looking at lagging and leading indicators, submit to performance evaluations. 

These are all fine and dandy, but you have to often judge things by other metrics. 

One way a leader can validate if things are working is if they get called *by peers* for advice. 

Your subordinates asking for advice is not the same thing. 

When your peers call you asking for advice, they're signaling that what you're doing is working and that they admire your perspective. 

If your peers aren't asking your advice, it's worth it to take some stock in what you're trying to accomplish and *actually ask* what others' perspective is of you. 

I did this several years ago. I went to someone and asked this very question: "How do others perceive me?" 

It was a hard conversation when he came back to me and told me what others think of me. 

But it helped me see blind spots that I was not able to see.
