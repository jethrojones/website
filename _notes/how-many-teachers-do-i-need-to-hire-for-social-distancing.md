With the coronavirus closures, so many schools don’t know what it’s going to look like this fall.

That’s understandable.

We’re all in this together.

I’ve heard from many principals who are wondering exactly how to reopen schools, and what that will look like.

*   Should we focus on safety?
*   Should we focus on social distancing?
*   Should we focus on #blacklivesmatter?
*   Should we just get kids back in a routine?
*   Should we plan for academics, or SEL, or just focus on mental health?
*   Should we focus on culture?
*   Will we even have the budget for all the teachers we need in a non-shutdown school?
*   Is it mathematically possible to rotate 1550 students 5 days a week in school and maintain 6 feet social distancing? And provide teachers the prep they need to plan?
*   Is it possible to get all our kids to school on buses where they need to be 6’ apart?
*   Honestly, can we just stop worrying about the coronavirus, yet?

There are so many questions about reopening schools. It’s just overwhelming.

I’ve learned that sometimes it helps to vent.

So, I have the unenviable opportunity to do just that. I’m going to let you vent to me!

Here’s your action step:

Shoot me [an email](mailto:jethro@hey.com) and tell me all that you’re worried about with reopening. Make it long or short. Bulleted or verbal diarrhea,

I can’t promise that I can solve all your problems, but I can promise that I will read every response and you will know that you are heard.
