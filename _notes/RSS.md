I set up two RSS feeds for this site. 
<!--more-->
The [first RSS feed is for the blog posts](https://jethro.site/feed.xml). These are the files that go specifically in the blog post folder. 

They are essentially the blog posts from my old blogs, squarespace and blogger, which are no longer going to be updated. 

The [second RSS feed is for the notes](https://jethro.site/feed_notes.xml), which are all the things that I write in markdown in Obsidian. 

I may update this page later to include information about more RSS feeds as I go deeper down my nerdy pathways!
