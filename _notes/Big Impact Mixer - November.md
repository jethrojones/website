This week, I'm going to share with you three reasons why you should have a podcast to go help you make your big impact. 

I'll share how I got someone who charges $50,000 to speak to come on my podcast for free, how I've networked with some of the greatest minds because of my podcast, and why it is essential to helping you make the impact you want. 

Then, we will take a few minutes in breakout rooms working together to figure out how to make your podcast work for you and your idea. 

Several of you already have podcasts. I hope you'll still attend and share how your podcast has helped you with your big impact. 

If you want to join us this Thursday at 10 am, sign up at [Big Impact Mixer](https://bigimpactmixer.com), and I'll add you to this invite only experience.
