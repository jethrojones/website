This week, I'm going to share with you three reasons why you should have a podcast to go help you make your big impact. 

I'll share how I got someone who charges $50,000 to speak to come on my podcast for free, how I've networked with some of the greatest minds because of my podcast, and why it is essential to helping you make the impact you want. 

Then, we will take a few minutes in breakout rooms working together to figure out how to make your podcast work for you and your idea. 

Several of you already have podcasts. I hope you'll still attend and share how your podcast has helped you with your big impact. 

If you want to join us this Thursday at 10 am, sign up at [Big Impact Mixer](https://bigimpactmixer.com), and I'll add you to this invite only experience. 

# Questions for Breakout
1. What would a podcast for your big impact look like? 
2. Story, Solo, or Seeker?
3. Is your idea broad enough that you could talk about it every week for the next decade and not run out of things to talk about? 
4. Make a list of all the people you would want to talk to, big or small. 
5. Make a list of all the topics/questions/case studies/etc. you would talk about.
6. Make a list of or describe the person you're making the podcast for.
