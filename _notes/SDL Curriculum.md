# Personalized



We intentionally do not have a standard curriculum that we put every student through. Instead, we help students identify what they need to learn, and help them through that path.

# Strengths-based



First and foremost, we help kids capitalize on their strengths. If they are good in math, we push them as far as they can go. If they are good readers, we challenge them to read deeper and more challenging texts.

# Weaknesses addressed



But we don't forget about their weaknesses. We use their strenghts to make their weaknesses strong.

How does this work? Let's say your student just wants to read fantasy novels, but doesn't think that math is important. Our learning coaches help students identify math concepts in the book that they are reading so we can support their development in other areas.
