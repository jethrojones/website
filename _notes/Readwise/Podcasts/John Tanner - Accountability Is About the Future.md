> Speaker 0: tomorrow. I'll just run through a few, one of them is that the first question out of our mouths always should be. What are we trying to accomplish? The first question should never be. What are we trying to measure That is a principal or a rule that opens up all kinds of possibilities in this world. That is, is so consumed with this test data and the state accountability. The reason you want to start with, what do we want to accomplish is because only about 5-10% of what matters in a child's life can be reduced to empirical data. And if we start with, what are we trying, you know, what, how do we measure that or what are we trying to measure? The probability of us getting around to?

> Speaker 0: to the safety and well being of my child. I understand not just that you're creating a safe space for them, but do they feel safe because you may have the safest school in the world and it may feel like a prison to the child and they're not in an optimized learning environment in that case. So part of it is it, I don't know that it's so much that the parents And the community, I don't know that I have really big open ended questions that they ought to be asking. I think it's beholden on the schools to say these are the 25-30 things that matter in schools which of these is of most concern to you at the moment, which of these do you most want to address and talk about. And again, I say that because one of the things that we discover in ([Time 0:30:08](https://www.airr.io/quote/61676b813b174903fac4ee53))

Business keeps its people safe in order to not lose work time and again, increased productivity. We keep kids safe because it's part of our mission. And again, it's not that businesses don't care, that's not it. It's a lot of things rise to the level of mission in schools. ([Time 0:33:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/61676c663b174903fac5c16d))
