> Clark spent his entire career at Harvard Business School. All seven of his children were born during the first ten years of his career. During that time period, he established a rigid pattern of coming home from the office each night at dinnertime and leaving work behind. He realized early on that if he was happy and fulfilled at home, he would be more productive and effective at work. The trick was keeping up with his peers and competitors who were logging far more hours at the office. “In business, the number of hours a person puts in is not a good indicator of output and performance,” Clark said. “What really matters is being able to create high-quality time and very high-quality production.” ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9INIQ&location=179))

> In many respects, each of these men is unique even within his own religion. “I think there are a lot of things about the Church that hold people back from becoming a CEO,” said Neeleman. “There is a real focus on the family and a real focus on a certain kind of living in Utah. A lot of people who could have done great things or better things didn’t do it because they just didn’t feel like they wanted to leave the sameness of Utah.” ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9INIQ&location=517))

> “As a brand-new partner at Deloitte and a new secretary to the board of directors, I already knew how to lead that group of fifteen directors from the most powerful position in the room. An executive secretary has the smallest title in the room. But you’re the guy with the pen. And as the guy with the pen, you are managing what’s happening in the room and you’re managing the action and the follow-through that occurs after the meeting.” ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9INIQ&location=798))

> The trick, he said, is distinguishing between what’s most important and what’s urgent. “It will never be urgent to put Easter eggs in the yard with my grandson,” Crittenden said. “But it can be very important. So the question is what are the truly important things that I want to achieve in life and how do I plan those into my calendar first to ensure those things get done? Then you have to deal with the urgent things that are important, typically because they arise at work.” Crittenden reserves an hour every Sunday night to review his calendar for the upcoming week. That’s when he sorts out the important from the urgent. In this process he applies the general rules above to the three primary areas that demand his time: his family, his occupation, and his church.

> “This sounds pretty programmed,” Crittenden said. “But in order to get a lot done requires a lot of structure. My life is so structured that I literally know where I’m going to be most days between now and a year from ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9INIQ&location=1711))

> That and the look on his face as he walked through the front door told his wife, Beverly, that a major financial fiasco had occurred. “What’s wrong?” she asked. Silent, Rod dropped his briefcase on the sofa and removed his suit jacket, tie, and shoes. Then he walked past the children, out the back door, and to the pool. Fully clothed, he jumped in. Beverly couldn’t believe it. The kids loved it. Convinced their father was playing a game, some of them jumped in before bothering to change into their bathing suits, too. Beverly couldn’t help but laugh. After about five minutes, Rod emerged from the pool with a smile. “I am having a mid-life crisis and that is all the time I had to give it,” he told her. Then he went off to his bedroom to change his clothes. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9INIQ&location=1791))

> “People with a high need for achievement have this unconscious drive when they have an extra half hour of time or ounce of energy to allocate that time and energy to whatever activity gives us the most important evidence that we’ve achieved something,” Christensen said. “Of all the things that are competing for our energy and time, our careers offer by far the most tangible evidence of significant achievement. So we close a sale, ship a product, finish a project, complete a presentation, teach a great class, get paid, get promoted. All of these things are tangible evidences of our self-worth and our achievement.” Families are a different story. “Our activities with our family offer very few evidences of immediate and tangible achievements,” Christensen said. “My kids misbehave every day. The house gets messy every day. So what if I’m busy tonight and don’t get home until eight? My wife will still love me and my marriage will be fine because it was yesterday. “It’s not until twenty years later that you can put your hands on your hips and say I raised great kids,” said Christensen. “It’s a long-term investment. So people with a high need for achievement have a systematic bias to invest time and energy in those activities which, in the long run, will cause them to under-invest in relationships that will lead to the greatest health and happiness over the long run.” ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9INIQ&location=2004))
