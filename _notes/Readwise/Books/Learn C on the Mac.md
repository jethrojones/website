## Highlights
###### ID 38689930
> A function is a chunk of source code that accomplishes a specific task. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=485))
    
###### ID 38689931
> A function declaration consists of a return type, the function name, and a pair of parentheses wrapped around a parameter list. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=497))
    
###### ID 38689932
> Following the declaration comes the body of the function. The body is always placed between a pair of curly braces: { and }. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=500))
    
###### ID 38689933
> The body of a function consists of a series of statements. The simplest statements are typically followed by a semicolon (;). ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=503))
    
###### ID 38689934
> The second type of mistake is a semantic error, or a flaw in your program’s algorithm. An algorithm is the approach used to solve a problem. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=518))
    
###### ID 38689935
> Note that the definition of a function is where you actually provide the function body. A function declaration does not include curly braces. A function definition does include curly braces. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=802))
    
###### ID 38689936
> Working with Variables ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=874))
    
###### ID 38689937
> Working with variables is a two-stage process. First you create a variable; then you use the variable. In C, you create a variable by declaring it. Declaring a variable tells the compiler, “Create a variable for me. I need a container to place a piece of data in.” When you declare a variable, you have to specify the variable’s type as well as its name. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=879))
    
###### ID 38689938
> For example, the operator == determines whether the expression on the left is equal in value to the expression on the right. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1481))
    
###### ID 38689939
> If the statement is simple, follow the semicolon rules for simple statements and place a semicolon at the end of the statement. If the statement is compound, follow the semicolon rules for that particular type of ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1623))
    
###### ID 38689940
> statement. ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1624))
    
###### ID 38689941
> The semicolon by itself doesn’t do anything but fill the bill where a statement is needed. ([Location 1629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1629))
    
###### ID 38689942
> The while statement is also known as the while loop, because once the statement is executed, the while loops back to reevaluate the expression. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1634))
    
###### ID 38689943
> The for Statement ([Location 1671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1671))
    
###### ID 38689944
> This first expression is evaluated once, at the beginning of the loop. The second expression is identical in function to the expression in a while statement, providing the termination condition for the loop. This expression is evaluated each time through the loop, before the statement is executed. Finally, the third expression provides the modification portion of the for statement. This expression is evaluated at the bottom of the loop, immediately following execution of the statement. ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1676))
    
###### ID 38689945
> The do Statement ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1754))
    
###### ID 38689946
> The switch Statement ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1764))

> Stepping Through the isOdd Source Code ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1827))
    - Note: Using a for statement to list a bunch of answers
    
###### ID 38689948
> What Is a Pointer? ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1929))
    
###### ID 38689949
> pointers are references to other things. When someone calls your name to get your attention, they’re using your name as a pointer. ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=1930))
    
###### ID 38689950
> The & operator (also called the address-of operator) pairs with a variable name to produce the variable’s address. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2016))
    
###### ID 38689951
> Declaring a Pointer Variable C supports a special notation for declaring pointer variables. The following line declares a variable named myPointer: ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2023))
    
###### ID 38689952
> Function Parameters ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2089))
    
###### ID 38689953
> Function parameters are like variables, but instead of being declared at the beginning of a function, function parameters are declared between the parentheses on the function’s title line, like this: ([Location 2114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2114))
    
###### ID 38689954
> Here’s one final point: The value passed in to a function is known as an argument. The variable declared to receive that argument is known as a parameter. In this line of code: DrawDots( 30 );   the constant 30 is an argument being passed to DrawDots(); it’s not a parameter. ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2155))
    
###### ID 38689955
> Global variables are variables that are accessible from inside every function in your program. ([Location 2203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2203))
    
###### ID 38689956
> functions written in C have the ability to return a value to the function that calls them. ([Location 2206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2206))
    
###### ID 38689957
> We’re using this global variable to trace our path through the program. ([Location 2362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKVAO&location=2362))
