> In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s mind there are few. —Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind ([Location 10](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=10))

###### ID 234484799
> My résumé said I was a learned, accomplished soldier, a twenty-four-year-old man in full . . . So why, I wondered, why do I still feel like a kid? ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=34))
    
###### ID 234484800
> Like all my friends I wanted to be successful. Unlike my friends I didn’t know what that meant. ([Location 40](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=40))
    
###### ID 234484801
> I saw my Crazy Idea shining up ahead, and it didn’t look all that crazy. It didn’t even look like an idea. It looked like a place. It looked like a person, or some life force that existed long before I did, separate from me, but also part of me. Waiting for me, but also hiding from me. That might sound a little high-flown, a little crazy. But that’s how I felt back then. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=64))
    
###### ID 234484802
> For that matter, few ideas are as crazy as my favorite thing, running. It’s hard. It’s painful. It’s risky. The rewards are few and far from guaranteed. When you run around an oval track, or down an empty road, you have no real destination. At least, none that can fully justify the effort. The act itself becomes the destination. It’s not just that there’s no finish line; it’s that you define the finish line. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=74))
    
###### ID 234484803
> Don’t stop. Don’t even think about stopping until you get there, and don’t give much thought to where “there” is. Whatever comes, just don’t stop. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=81))

> Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that. —Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=85))

> Colonial house, beautiful wife, obedient kids, my father enjoyed having these things, but what he really cherished was his friends and neighbors knowing he had them. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=135))
    
###### ID 234484807
> It was my first real awareness that not everyone in this world will like us, or accept us, that we’re often cast aside at the very moment we most need to be included. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0176M1A44&location=223))
