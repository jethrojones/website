> To define terms and concepts so that users share a common understanding; To establish organizational norms by specifying internet-related or electronic activity that is unacceptable (in fact, some companies refer to their policies as “Unacceptable Use Policies”); and To specify the consequences of violating one or more provisions of the AUP.

> a FAUP can help children understand, even at an early age, that cyberspace is not a morality-free or consequence-free zone, and that cyberethical behavior is just as important (if not a little bit more so) than offline ethics. ([Location 51](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=51))
    
###### ID 234481735
> I urge parents to delay the use of electronic devices by children as long as possible. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=59))
    
###### ID 234481736
> The longer your children can go without using devices and the less they use them, the better off they will be. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=61))
    
###### ID 234481737
> iGen, a generation of children whose entire worldview is shaped by what they see and hear online. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=63))
    - Note: Example, Cali completely incredulous that we would ask her to use her device while it was plugged in. It just didn’t make any sense to her. It was a battery first device, not a plugged-in first device.
    
###### ID 234481738
> while schools can play a critical role in reinforcing generally held cyberethical standards, the moral education of children is the responsibility of each household. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=67))
    
###### ID 234481739
> It’s not something that we should expect (or want) a government to do for us. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=68))
    
###### ID 234481740
> Kids are both natural imitators and keen hypocrisy-sniffers. Inevitably, they will mirror your good and not-so-good online behaviors. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=81))
    
###### ID 234481741
> they’ll start having playdates in homes with a variety of different electronic devices and rules for using them. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=114))
    - Note: Our rule about not using devices when friends are over. Playing games on devices is not appropriate. As the kids get older, turning in their phones when they have friends over may be a good way to do it.
    
###### ID 234481742
> it’s pretty much impossible to prevent a child from ever seeing undesirable things online, and it happens a lot sooner than most of us would like. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=116))
    
###### ID 234481743
> The problem is that 7-year-olds more easily imagine the consequences of playground rule violations (the vocal scorn of peers, mostly, or social shunning) than the much more theoretical but potentially far more severe impact of online mistakes. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=124))
    
###### ID 234481744
> Try not to let it get covered up by other papers, photos, take-out menus, etc. If that starts to happen, it’s a good sign that it’s probably time to revisit the FAUP and see if it needs to be updated. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=131))
    
###### ID 234481745
> A FAUP will not serve as a useful household resource if it is not periodically revised to reflect your child’s intellectual and emotional development. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=134))
    
###### ID 234481746
> The critical thing to remember is that a FAUP is not a parenting panacea. By itself, it will not prevent electronic misbehavior, and it’s certainly not a substitute for adequate communication and supervision. But it will help you and your children establish commonly understood ground rules for online behavior that reflect the social and cultural values you want them to learn. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=144))
    
###### ID 234481747
> A vital step in minimizing potential problems down the road is helping children to understand that they can’t simply pick up and use any device they see. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=157))
    
###### ID 234481748
> clean hands, no food or drink nearby, use the device in public space, be willing to share, no temper tantrums, and so on. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=162))
    
###### ID 234481749
> A study published in the fall of 2010 found that 92% of toddlers in the United States already had a “digital footprint,” ranging from posted copies of pre-natal sonograms to email addresses and social network profiles. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=174))
    
###### ID 234481750
> The truth of the matter, however, is that kids today can stumble across far more shocking and explicit material than even the most wayward child could find twenty years ago. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=191))
    
###### ID 234481751
> If you do decide to install internet filtering or logging software, should you tell your child that you have done so? ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=202))

> make it less likely that he or she will confide in you if something goes wrong. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=206))
    
###### ID 234481753
> It is precisely the type of communication-building exercise that will make later electronics issues a bit easier to handle. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=210))
    
###### ID 234481754
> Other studies have concluded that parents remain “the single most important factor in helping children and adolescents grow up healthy,” and that in times of crisis or critical decision-making, children turn most often to parents. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=219))
    
###### ID 234481755
> The statistics are startling. In 2005, for instance, 12% of all elementary students in the United States carried a cell phone. Over the last fifteen years, that percentage has nearly doubled; now, 2 in 5 elementary students bring a cell phone to school each day, and about a third of those are smartphones. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=246))
    
###### ID 234481756
> At the end of the day, it’s not about the device. It’s about the behavior. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HLCLSDT&location=254))
