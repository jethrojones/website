## Highlights
###### ID 234482257
> God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but what he will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them, for the day must come when no man need say to his neighbor, Know ye the Lord; for all shall know him … from the least to the greatest. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=716))

> truisms lack sharp meaning, they are hazy concepts that just feel true, whereas truths are facts and principles understood in a brighter light. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=823))
    
###### ID 234482259
> These faithful and prototypical Three Nephites were even more blessed than the nine who requested to speedily come into the Father’s kingdom following their mortal labors. If you stop to analyze what the nine were actually requesting, they were asking to skip the spirit world of disembodied life, and all other events mentioned above, and speedily come into the presence of the Father, which suggests that they were requesting to be resurrected immediately and enter into eternal glory. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=894))

> Translation is not the only path to exaltation, but it is the preferred path for mortals when it is offered in the current dispensation. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=903))
    
###### ID 234482261
> In fact, it appears that the millennial Zion will exist quietly at first, invisible to those who do not have ears to hear and eyes to see. It will consist of those who have privately and individually heard the call of Zion through the Holy Ghost, who have believed and walked the straighter path, kept sacred covenants, viewed the “mysteries of godliness” in inspired light, and who have become Zion themselves through an invitation into the presence of Christ. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1028))
    
###### ID 234482262
> Also intriguing is the fact that Brigham Young tried for a while to begin anew to establish Zion, but in time gave up. Since his tenure as prophet, no formal attempt has been made to establish Zion as a city. In other words, we have been living that portion of the gospel that remains after the opportunity to build Zion has been extracted. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1581))
    
###### ID 234482263
> But we learned that Zion cannot be built up based upon programs. Brigham Young knew that Zion could not be built when the people were not willing to live the higher laws of Zion. This realization was undoubtedly the source of the discouragement felt in the above quotes. ([Location 1600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1600))
    
###### ID 234482264
> Zion is a society of people who have quietly reengineered their lives to the pattern of celestial law, who have sought and found the blessings of Divine company, and while in the presence of God, have asked for the privilege of being changed to the pattern of Zion. ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1606))
    
###### ID 234482265
> The only tweak that is required to our belief system is to believe that we will arrive at that state during this life. ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1635))
    
###### ID 234482266
> With the limited worldview of Zion as a physical place now beyond our reach and not a spiritual state of being, it appears we lost the motivation to continue to build a Zion society when we lost ownership of the real estate of Zion. ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1650))
    
###### ID 234482267
> During that transitory time it is likely that the Church as we know it will perform a parallel role by maintaining its commission in the world at large, sending out missionaries, building buildings, and collecting tithing even while a portion of that same organization has become Zion, perfected and glorious, where missionaries will be translated beings, and buildings will be constructed by the creative power of God. ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1701))
    
###### ID 234482268
> In its infancy, the call of Zion is a quiet urging, a hunger of sorts that will not be filled by anything less than a glory your spirit knows awaits, but which you cannot yet define. ([Location 1804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1804))
    
###### ID 234482269
> Then do not be too anxious for the Lord to hasten his work. Let our anxiety be centered upon this one thing, the sanctification of our own hearts, the purifying of our own affections, the preparing of ourselves for the approach of events that are hastening upon us. This should be our concern, this should be our study, this should be our daily prayer, and not be in a hurry to see the overthrow of the wicked. ([Location 1823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1823))
    
###### ID 234482270
> Zion must first blossom in the souls of a people; then when those souls are called to gather, the physical environs they inhabit become Zion because of their righteous presence. ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1830))
    
###### ID 234482271
> So we look again to the eastern sky for signs of the glorious coming. In this light, it is startling that we may possibly be falling into a similar trap as our ancient brethren. ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1916))
    
###### ID 234482272
> It requires monumental faith to translate a promise given to all mankind into a personal belief as seemingly audacious as “I can seek and obtain a personal audience with my Savior.” It almost seems irreverent to so believe, as if one is leapfrogging an entire paradigm of mortality—which is that God only appears to prophets, period. The internalization of a belief that you, or I, can and must find ourselves on the other side of the veil in this life is almost superhuman. ([Location 1999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=1999))
    
###### ID 234482273
> The power of what it tells us is that every soul who follows this process may partake of the divine gift—not just the anointed few, but every soul. The process is thus defined: ([Location 2015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2015))
    
###### ID 234482274
> 1. “Forsake your sins.” ([Location 2017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2017))
    
###### ID 234482275
> 2. “Come unto me.” ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2023))
    
###### ID 234482276
> To come unto Christ, one must hear His voice and turn toward the sound thereof with faith-born desire. ([Location 2025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2025))
    
###### ID 234482277
> 3. “Call on my name.” ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2036))
    
###### ID 234482278
> Since no unclean thing (including voices) can come into the presence of the Father, as mortals we simply are not worthy to petition the Father in our own behalf to ask for blessings—let alone to petition for forgiveness, intercession, insight, visions, miracles, or visitations and a fulness of His glory. ([Location 2039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2039))
    
###### ID 234482279
> 4. “Obey my voice.” ([Location 2069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2069))
    
###### ID 234482280
> 5. “Keep my commandments.” ([Location 2093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2093))
    
###### ID 234482281
> It works like this: You live your life in obedience to the still small voice. If you are aware of its presence, you will hear it. It will constitute many promptings to do something, or perhaps, to not do something. The key is to do exactly as it guides you without hesitation. ([Location 2101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2101))
    
###### ID 234482282
> 6. “See My Face and Know That I Am.” ([Location 2138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2138))
    
###### ID 234482283
> To believe all the rest of the gospel and yet not believe we have the privilege of seeing God is to only believe a lesser portion of the gospel (Alma 12:10–11). ([Location 2245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2245))
    
###### ID 234482284
> At some point we must cease looking at the scriptures as an inspired history book of the lives of the ancient faithful and begin to look at it more as a divine mail order catalog. ([Location 2251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2251))
    
###### ID 234482285
> being a priesthood holder does not give us a greater privilege in obtaining these promised blessings. The power of the priesthood is in the ordinances, not in the offices. ([Location 2266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2266))
    
###### ID 234482286
> Let us not siphon the virtue from this glorious promise by assuming that this divine audience with deity is the inevitable day when we will all kneel before Him to be judged, or some automatic event at death. ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2299))
    
###### ID 234482287
> No book adequately describes the mysteries because it is not possible to communicate such things by words to readers—inspired or otherwise. Each person must obtain these truths through personal effort and personal righteousness. ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2312))
    
###### ID 234482288
> Once a mystery is understood, it becomes obvious and evident throughout the scriptures. When our eyes are at last opened to a mystery, we “see” it everywhere. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2317))
    
###### ID 234482289
> Through the scriptures we are allowed to view the powerful effect of these gifts and mysteries in the lives of the ancient faithful. Most all of us believe in their blessings. What we often can’t see is the invitation to step forth and partake for ourselves. ([Location 2323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2323))
    
###### ID 234482290
> Where in the scriptures are the mysteries to be found? They’re actually easy to find. Read until you come to a passage or phrase you don’t understand, or to which you have an indistinct, warm-fuzzy understanding. Most probably it is an oft-repeated phrase. ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2324))
    
###### ID 234482291
> Once a seeker has learned a mystery, mortal language is not able to make it known to another. ([Location 2328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2328))
    
###### ID 234482292
> It means you will eventually obtain it. In other words, if the Holy Spirit opens it to your view, it is yours to pursue. ([Location 2351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2351))
    
###### ID 234482293
> The living prophet, the scriptures, and the Holy Spirit always agree. ([Location 2354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2354))
    
###### ID 234482294
> In summary, the process looks like this: •   Recognize that the gift is being offered. •   Pray for and obtain a firm belief that God desires you to partake of the gift. •   Exercise your faith in learning what God desires of you inorder to obtain the blessing. This is the law upon which that blessing is predicated for you personally (D&C 130:21). •   Obey the law forevermore. •   Obtain the blessing. ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007TY27W4&location=2374))
