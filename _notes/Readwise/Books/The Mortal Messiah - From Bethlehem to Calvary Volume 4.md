> But now it is Wednesday, April 5, 13th Nisan, A.D. 30, and tomorrow is the day for the slaying of thousands of Paschal lambs. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=79))

> As to the day on which Jesus spoke these words, Edersheim says: "The day before that on which the Paschal Lamb [that is, he himself] was to be slain, with all that was to follow, would be one of rest, a Sabbath to His Soul before its Great Agony. He would refresh Himself, gather Himself up for the terrible conflict before Him. . . . Only two days more, as the Jews reckoned them—that Wednesday and Thursday—and at its Even the Paschal supper! And Jesus knew it well, and He passed that day of rest and preparation in quiet retirement with His disciples—perhaps in some hollow of the Mount of Olives, near the home of Bethany—speaking to them of His Crucifixion on the near Passover." (Edersheim 2:468-69.) 1 ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=84))

> Thirty pieces of silver! (Ex. 21:28-32.) "They 'weighed out' to him from the very Temple-treasury those thirty pieces of silver. . . . It was surely as much in contempt of the seller as of Him Whom he sold, that they paid the legal price of a slave. Or did they mean some kind of legal fiction, such as to buy the Person of Jesus at the legal price of a slave, so as to hand it afterwards over to the secular authorities? Such fictions, to save the conscience by a logical quibble, are not so uncommon—and the case of the Inquisitors handing over the condemned heretic to the secular authorities will recur to the mind. But, in truth, Judas could not now have escaped their toils. They might have offered him ten or five pieces of silver, and he must still have stuck to his bargain. Yet none the less do we mark the deep symbolic significance of it all, in that the Lord was, so to speak, paid for out of the Temple-money which was destined for the purchase of sacrifices, and that He, Who took on Him the form of a servant, was sold and bought at the legal price of a slave." (Edersheim 2:477.) ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=193))

> Why did Judas become a traitor and seek to betray Jesus? Mark says, "He turned away from him, and was offended because of his words." Luke says simply: "Then entered Satan into Judas." And Matthew preserves for us the words spoken by this evil apostle to the chief priests: "What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?" John said of him: "He was a thief." (John 12:1-6.) In all of this Judas displays disbelief, a rejection of the gospel, personal offense against the word—all because of the gospel truism: "The guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center." (1 Ne. 16:2.) ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=200))

> But Farrar, whose gift is to wield the witchery of words, also points to the basic and obvious reason for Judas's act. It was sin—evil, wicked, soul-blackening sin. In this—and let there be no mistake on this point—Judas was no different from the thousands and millions of sinners who preceded him and the billions who have come after. Why does any traitor betray his friends? Why are there crimes and murders and wars? "From whence come wars and fightings among you?" James asks. His declarative answer, though given in the form of a question, is: "Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?" (James 4:1.) ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=227))

> As to the way the Jews reckoned days, "the day always belonged to the previous night. . . . The day lasted till three stars became visible. . . . In regard to the Passover, it is distinctly stated that it began with the darkness on the 14th Nisan." (Edersheim 2:468-69, footnote 2.) ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=248))

> Then he took Peter, James, and John with him on into the Garden. As they went he "rebuked them"—apparently for the doubt that arose in their hearts that he was the Messiah—and said: "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here and watch." Then he withdrew from them "about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed." The statement that he "kneeled" is Luke's; Mark says he "fell on the ground [that is, prostrated himself], and prayed." Matthew says he "fell on his face." No doubt he did all of these things, over a long period and in the course of repeated prayers. ([Location 1629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1629))

> There is no mystery to compare with the mystery of redemption, not even the mystery of creation. Finite minds can no more comprehend how and in what manner Jesus performed his redeeming labors than they can comprehend how matter came into being, or how Gods began to be. Perhaps the very reason Peter, James, and John slept was to enable a divine providence to withhold from their ears, and seal up from their eyes, those things which only Gods can comprehend. ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1638))

> Then, as nearly as we can determine, and as Luke records: "There appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him." The angelic ministrant is not named. We know that on the Mount of Transfiguration "Moses and Elias. . . appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem" (Luke 9:30-31); and if we might indulge in speculation, we would suggest that the angel who came into this second Eden was the same person who dwelt in the first Eden. At least Adam, who is Michael, the archangel—the head of the whole heavenly hierarchy of angelic ministrants—seems the logical one to give aid and comfort to his Lord on such a solemn occasion. Adam fell, and Christ redeemed men from the fall; theirs was a joint enterprise, both parts of which were essential for the salvation of the Father's children.

> "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground." The Son of God who did all things well—whose every thought and act and deed was perfect; whose every prayer pierced the firmament and ascended to his Father—the Son of God himself (note it well) "prayed more earnestly." Even he reached a pinnacle of Perfection in prayer that had not always been his. ([Location 1651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1651))

> As he went into Gethsemane, it was with a total awareness of what lay ahead. "Jesus knew that the awful hour of His deepest humiliation had arrived—that from this moment till the utterance of that great cry with which He expired, nothing remained for Him on earth but the torture of physical pain and the poignancy of mental anguish. All that the human frame can tolerate of suffering was to be heaped upon His shrinking body; every misery that cruel and crushing insult can inflict was to weigh heavy on His soul; and in this torment of body and agony of soul even the high and radiant serenity of His divine spirit was to suffer a short but terrible eclipse. Pain in its acutest sting, shame in its most overwhelming brutality, all the burden of the sin and mystery of man's existence in its apostasy and fall—this was what He must now face in all its most inexplicable accumulation." (Farrar, ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1666))

> And as he came out of the Garden, delivering himself voluntarily into the hands of wicked men, the victory had been won. There remained yet the shame and the pain of his arrest, his trials, and his cross. But all these were overshadowed by the agonies and sufferings in Gethsemane. It was on the cross that he "suffered death in the flesh," even as many have suffered agonizing deaths, but it was in Gethsemane that "he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him." (D&C 18:11.) ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1685))
    - Note: The garden was worse than anything

> Having conspired beforehand with the chief priests and Pharisees—"Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast," was his promise—Judas must first have led the evil band to the house in Jerusalem where the holy party celebrated the Feast of the Passover. Finding them gone, and, as we suppose, rousing John Mark in the process, Judas then led those under his command to Gethsemane which he knew was the place to which they commonly resorted. Finding Jesus and the Eleven, Judas called out "Hail master"—'Hail Rabbi'—and kissed him; or, better, as the Greek text conveys, "not only kissed but covered Him with kisses, kissed Him repeatedly, loudly, effusively." (Edersheim 2:543.) There must be no mistake made as to the identity of Jesus; the promised sign must be clear and certain. It was the custom to greet friends and guests with a kiss; Jesus himself had condemned his host, Simon the Pharisee, by saying, "Thou gavest me no kiss." (Luke 7:45.) There must be absolute certainty in the kiss of betrayal, and so Judas showered Jesus with kisses, which but makes the traitorous act all the more repulsive. Jesus then said: "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" And then: 'Friend'—for so Judas is identified in the Messianic prophecy—'do that for which thou art come.'

> From Gethsemane they take Him to evil Annas—an adulterous Jew; a one-time high priest; the father-in-law of Caiaphas—and there He is examined and smitten. This is their hour—the hour of darkness. In all Israel there is not a more wicked or influential man than Annas, who commits himself to see that Jesus is put to death. They take him before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin. They plot a judicial murder, seek false witnesses, find him guilty of blasphemy, and say: "He is worthy of death." He is maltreated by the guards as they await the morning trial. Peter, before the cock crows twice, thrice denies that he knows him. Then he is hailed before the Sanhedrin in formal session, where he testifies that he is the Son of God, and "the whole council condemned him" and sent him bound to Pilate. Pilate, whose hands reek with blood, yet seeks to free him. Jesus testifies that he is a king, but that his kingdom is not of this world. As a Galilean he is sent to Herod to be examined and derided. There he remains silent. Before Pilate again he is charged with sedition and treason. Pilate seeks to release him, but the people demand Bar-Abbas instead and shriek, "Crucify him, crucify him."

###### ID 38689432
> From Gethsemane—a sacred place, hallowed by the blood of Jesus, sweat in agonizing drops from every pore—to the palace of Annas—an evil, wicked, adulterous Jew—Jesus was taken, bound and subservient, by the Roman soldiers and the temple guards. The alien power and the Jewish rulers were placing the Judge of all the earth into the custody of wicked men to be judged by an evil and apostate court system. ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1788))

> Jesus was judged of men that the scriptures might be fulfilled, that the atonement might be completed, that immortality might pass upon all men, and that the saints of the Most High might be inheritors of eternal life in the Everlasting Presence. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1797))
    
###### ID 38689434
> Jesus was subjected to three Jewish trials. The first, before Annas, though unofficial in the strict sense, was the one that assured the ultimate Roman-imposed penalty of death. It was the crowning act of conspiratorial evil; the authoritative prejudging of him who, according to their law, should have been presumed to be innocent. It was the practical trial; the one before the de facto high priest; before the recognized source of Jewish power; before the one who wielded the real power of the Jewish people. ([Location 1801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1801))
    
###### ID 38689435
> The second trial, before Caiaphas, though involved primarily with preliminary questioning, was the occasion when the real or formal determination was made that the Guiltless One, the Sinless One, was worthy of death. And the third trial, before the Sanhedrin, constituted a ratification of the illegal procedures before Annas and Caiaphas; in it the formal decision was pronounced; strictly speaking it was the only real and legal trial, though, as we shall see, it too violated almost every basic and established rule, order, and law set down for Sanhedrinic operation. ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1805))
    
###### ID 38689436
> Who was Annas, as he is called by the Evangelists? He was the best known, one of the wealthiest, and certainly the most influential Jew of his day; and if wickedness be measured by evil opposition to the truth and by a desire to shed innocent blood, he ranks with Judas among the abominable of the earth. He was Hanan, the son of Seth, the Ananus of Josephus. He had been the actual high priest for some seven years, and since being deposed by the Procurator Valerius Gratus, he had been the power behind the priestly throne. In his degenerate day, when the high priests were appointed and deposed by Gentile overlords; when the office was more of a political than a religious one; when, in spite of the general moral decay, the office did require "a certain amount of external dignity and self-denial which some men would only tolerate for a time" (Farrar, p. 639)—under these circumstances, to appoint and control a high priest was greater and more to be desired than to be one.

> It was they who had founded the chanujoth—the famous four shops under the twin cedars of Olivet—in which were sold things legally pure, and which they had manipulated with such commercial cunning as artificially to raise the price of doves to gold coin apiece, until the people were delivered from this gross imposition by the indignant interference of a grandson of Hillel. There is every reason to believe that the shops which had intruded even under the Temple porticoes were not only sanctioned by their authority, but even managed for their profit. To interfere with these was to rob them of one important source of that wealth and worldly comfort to which they attached such extravagant importance.

> "Now Caiaphas was he"—as John is also careful to mention at this point—"which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people." (John 18:14.) As we are aware, this counsel of Caiaphas was a prophetic utterance. God had used him as he used Baalam's ass to proclaim a message to his people, and that message did not carry the meaning and intent that was in the evil heart of the wicked man whose tongue was then guided in what he said.

> Thus he "had been the first to enunciate in plain words what seemed to him the political necessity for the judicial murder of Christ. There had been no pretense on his part of religious motives or zeal for God; he had cynically put it in a way to override the scruples of those old Sanhedrists by raising their fears.

> They had before them a prisoner charged with no crime. Innocent of all crimes, as he was, even these conspiring Satanists had not been able to come up with an offense for which he could be arraigned. Annas had failed in his attempt to charge the disciples with sedition and Jesus with teaching false and apostate doctrines. Their dilemma was real, for they themselves were sharply divided on all major issues save one—that the man Jesus must die.

###### ID 38689442
> Since a charge must be lodged to justify Jesus' arrest, since they themselves were not sufficiently united to bring up any of their old doctrinal objections, and since the charge must be one that the Romans would consider to be a capital offense, "the chief priests, and elders, and all the council" (after counseling with Satan whose servants they were) chose the most evil of all possible courses. They "sought false witness"! ([Location 1910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1910))
    
###### ID 38689443
> "The purpose of the High-Priest was not to formulate a capital charge in Jewish Law, since the assembled Sanhedrists had no intention so to try Jesus, but to formulate a charge which would tell before the Roman Procurator. And here none other could be so effective as that of being a fanatical seducer of the ignorant populace, who might lead them on to wild tumultuous acts." (Edersheim 2:559.)

> How intense was the hatred of that hour! How many unseen demons must have laughed in the background as the legal high priest in Israel, speaking in Jehovah's name, adjured Jehovah himself to proclaim his own divine Sonship! No doubt the prince of devils himself was there; what is more natural than to expect the master of all evil to come face to face with Him that is the embodiment of all that is good? "Tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God!" Suppose, just suppose he was, what then of Caiaphas, and the Sanhedrin, and the Jewish nation? Would they be buffeted and scattered and scourged and hated of all men until the times of restitution? ([Location 1960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NOGEHY&location=1960))
