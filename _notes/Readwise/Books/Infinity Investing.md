###### ID 310376778
> According to the IRS, there are eight types of income. •Wages: This is the money that you are earning. •Profits: What you are making off of a business. •Rents: What you’re getting paid for someone else’s use of an asset, like renting a house. •Royalties: Typically this is money earned from intellectual property. To be honest, very few of you are going to have royalty income unless you write a book, music, or software. •Dividends: These are the payments from capital-C corporations where they pay you a part of their profits. In the United States we actually pay about half as much tax on dividends as we pay on other income. •Interest: This is money that you make off of principal. If you loan somebody money and you’re getting paid back the principal plus an agreed-upon amount each month, you made a little bit of interest income. •Short-term capital gains: This is where you sell something of value. Real estate is a great example. If you buy a house and sell the house within a year, that’s short-term capital gains. •Long-term capital gains: If you hold that same house for more than a year, then you have long-term capital gains.

Third, you can’t do an accountable plan because you are a tax disadvantage from a tax standpoint. And fourth, every dollar that you make is subject to self-employment taxes. It’s a complete whack-a-thon. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VFH9VQK&location=824))
    
###### ID 310376780
> Infinity Bucket: The best income source is real estate. I may never pay tax on real estate, and neither will my family. I could own real estate and it could grow from a dollar to $10 million, and I will have paid nothing in tax. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VFH9VQK&location=831))
    
###### ID 310376781
> What about dividends? They’re taxed at long-term capital gain rates at either 0 percent, 15 percent, or 20 percent, depending on what your tax bracket is. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VFH9VQK&location=834))

([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VFH9VQK&location=1112))
    
###### ID 310376791
