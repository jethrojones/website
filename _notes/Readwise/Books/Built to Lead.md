> Having documented processes clarifies each responsibility and makes it easy to train new employees. That’s how you successfully lay the foundation for massive growth. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=239))
    
###### ID 38689851
> The beauty of using motivation: you don’t need to use a cattle prod to get engaged employees to work, and work hard! ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=306))
    
###### ID 38689852
> "Success... is Making a Difference in the Lives of Others. Happiness... is Watching them Grow Because of It." ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=311))
    
###### ID 38689853
> “You can have everything you want in life IF you will just help others get what they want!" ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=315))

> "I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among the men," said Schwab, “the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a man is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a man as criticisms from his superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a man incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise." ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=336))

> Very few management coaching materials bring it all together, showing how managers AND employees WIN TOGETHER. At least 90% of the management books focus on how you can improve, but never mention your people. That, to me, is a real problem. This book will teach you how to create a win for everyone, and that I have guaranteed you. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=467))

> Now, you’ve done your recon, identify any underperforming team members who have not improved after you (and your management team) have invested the necessary time and effort to help them improve. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=573))
    
###### ID 38689857
> “Leaders don’t beat around the bush, son. They do what needs to be done immediately!” ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=610))
    
###### ID 38689858
> To help insure we maintain our strong team, I started a practice many years ago that I have passed on to my managers. Here it is. During the interview process I tell each prospective employee, “I don’t care how much money you bring into the company… IF the people you work with come and tell us you’re a ‘pain in the butt’ to work with, you’re outta here! Fair enough?” ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=626))

> My next challenge is to create the next generation high school, fill that school with innovative servant leaders, sell this school concept to the community, earn buy-in from all stakeholders, and create a high performing school centered around the individual student. Henry County, GA is on board for innovation and progressive thinking. I am more motivated than ever to contribute the next chapter to the book of educational leadership. I refuse to lay down my sword in the crusade for excellence in education. While the battle has shifted to a new state with a new set of challenges, I intend to contribute to the comeback of American Education in this ever-changing global marketplace. Being asked to contribute my story to this book is an honor. But I think my story has a long way to go. The premise, however, is that ferocious persistence in the name of God will pay off. I believe the lives of our kids are worth whatever comes next. Principal Todd Finn ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=700))

> You, as the manager, are only as good as your people. Understand this too: Your people are a direct reflection of you as their manager. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=730))
    
###### ID 38689861
> People who make excuses and shirk responsibility for where they are in life rarely move from where they are. If that’s you, knock it off NOW! ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=739))

> The late W. Edward Deming, known as the “Father of Quality Control,” once said, “85% of your results are determined in the first 15% of any process.” ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=756))
    
###### ID 38689863
> In the best organizations, employee engagement transcends a human resources initiative – it is the way they do business. Employee engagement is a strategic approach supported by tactics for driving improvement and organizational change. The best performing companies know that developing an employee engagement strategy and linking it to the achievement of corporate goals will help them win in the marketplace. ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=786))
    
###### ID 38689864
> Now, that’s a big transition – and no question, it’s hard. Being a leader basically requires a whole new mindset. You’re no longer constantly thinking, “How can I stand out?” but, “How can I help my people do their jobs better?” ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=844))
    
###### ID 38689865
> What I’m talking about is helping your people take their lives to the next level, which requires some “pruning and watering” on your part as their manager. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=869))
    
###### ID 38689866
> So, how do you become the leader you were meant to be? By helping your employees become who they were meant to be; it’s as simple as that. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=888))
    
###### ID 38689867
> Note: This is not something you can hand off to an Assistant Manager, or delegate to your human resources department. Don’t even think about it! They need to see that YOU are concerned for their welfare, and that YOU care enough to become involved and get in the trenches with them. This is huge! Do not miss the significance of this! ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1055))
    
###### ID 38689868
> If you are building leaders within your company, as you should be, many of your assistants will be promoted and move on to their own businesses. If they were doing all the training, the employee loyalty that was built with those assistant managers would go with them. Then the employees will still be there with you, and you will basically be starting from scratch in building trust and loyalty. Don’t make that mistake. For this to have the maximum impact you’ll want to experience, you must lead these training meetings yourself. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1058))
    - Note: principal must lead the professional development

> “Would you say to the fireplace, ‘Give me heat, and then I’ll give you some wood?’ Of course not! “Would you say to the field, ‘Give me crops, and then I’ll give you some seeds?’ No way! Then why would you say to your employer, ‘Give me more money, and then I’ll work harder for you?’’’ ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1406))

> Here’s the key ingredient to Adam’s success. Over the two years that he had been with my company, Adam had proven himself to be (though a very young one) a man of responsibility, character, and integrity. Three critical qualities needed in all your leaders. ([Location 1474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1474))
    
###### ID 38689871
> When you find these diamond in the rough employees, begin the polishing process, and you’ll simply be amazed at the priceless gems you’ll find just waiting for their chance to shine. ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1566))
    
###### ID 38689872
> Think about the people you know who’ve been promoted in your company. Ask yourself, “What kind of attitude did they have about themselves AND about the company?” I assure you, they believed in themselves and in the company they work for. I’m willing to bet that describes you too. ([Location 1796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1796))
    
###### ID 38689873
> Every employee you have is either a Patriot or a Mercenary. ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1819))
    - Note: Powerful
    
###### ID 38689874
> Are loyal to you and to the company. Know you genuinely care about them, and they appreciate you in return. Are shown appreciation when they do a good job, and are rewarded for it. Bond with other employees in the company, and have many friends there. Believe, and support, what you’re trying to do as a manager. ([Location 1821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1821))
    - Note: because you love them they will go to the end of the earth for you
    
###### ID 38689875
> Honestly, if you’re not showing your employees you care about them and appreciate them, you don’t deserve their loyalty! Do you honestly believe you can ever be successful if you have to rely on these mercenary employees to help you reach your career goals? Are these the type that make up a foundation you can build your business on? Not a chance! ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1837))
    - Note: you could equate this to the parable of the man who built his house upon the rock
    
###### ID 38689876
> But, let’s say you have one employee (out of the ten) that doesn’t want to go where you’re headed, and they decide to just sit down where they are. Now you have to drag them. With the extra weight you didn’t have to deal with before, your progress really slows down. Can you imagine how hard it would be to drag this loafer along with you? It would really wear the other nine employees down, wouldn’t it? This one employee is a disengaged employee. They don’t care what you’re doing, and will just sit there. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1871))

> “Leaders take decisive action... and losers don’t!” ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=1880))
    
###### ID 38689878
> I can’t begin to count the managers I’ve heard down through the years who say crazy things like, “I don’t have any of my 50 employees that deserve to be recognized!” What? Are you kidding me?!! Let me clear up something for you right now, and anyone whoever says something ignorant like this. If you don’t have someone (not one, but many employees... if you have 50) that deserves to be recognized for doing a great job that month, look in the mirror, my friend! There’s the problem! Your people deserve better, so be better! ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=2040))
    
###### ID 38689879
> Now, if they came to your store, and didn’t tell you to fix something, they probably won’t be a district manager too much longer. It’s the manager’s job (at any level) to tell those within their team how to fix or improve various aspects of their business to make them more successful. If any manager fails to do that, what good are they? Not much! ([Location 2082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=2082))
    - Note: leaders teach and correct.

> Shark’s Teeth Strategy of Leadership Development. Having grown up on the beaches of the North Carolina coast, and learning to surf as a teenager, I’m pretty familiar with sharks. Sometimes, a little too familiar. Let’s just say that I’ve seen a few of them up close and personal during my younger days. In fact, I actually petted one (purely by accident, I assure you) on the only day I ever skipped school… but that’s a story for another time. If you know anything about sharks, you know they have a set of teeth like no other creature on earth. In fact, it’s more like an assembly line with each front tooth having three or four other teeth behind it… just waiting for their opportunity to move up to the front row. Notice the multiple smaller teeth behind the front teeth in the shark’s mouth. If a tooth falls out, or is pulled out during an attack on its prey, another pops up to take its place. That is exactly what you need to think about as you develop your leadership team. Occasionally, for whatever reason, a manager either gets promoted (hopefully), leaves, or gets fired. Hey, it happens. Just like the shark’s teeth, you need to have another leader in reserve, ready to pop into place when their opportunity arises. All the current leaders in your business represent the front row of the shark’s teeth. ([Location 2142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MW3F8Y6&location=2142))
