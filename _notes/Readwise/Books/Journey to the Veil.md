> Membership alone doesn’t make us disciples of Christ, nor does it compel us to take Him as our shepherd. Discipleship is a personal quest and relationship with Jesus Christ and the Father developed through desire, obedience, and hungering and thirsting after them.

> This is the way of growth: Struggle, grow, receive blessings, bask in the blessings (honeymoon period), greater opposition, lessening of the Spirit, remain faithful, climb to new spiritual heights, start all over again.

> I prefer to begin in the Book of Mormon, but any book of scripture will yield its treasures to this method. Read until you find a point of doctrine that grabs your attention. ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GM5X07M&location=2569))

> However, right now Brother Joe isn’t ready to hearken to every prompting, because this seems like a grim sacrifice that he is not yet willing to make. ([Location 3247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GM5X07M&location=3247))

> If you can lay hold upon this concept, it will literally save your life and ease your transition into the millennial day (Doctrine & Covenants 88:82–85). If we are already terrestrial, having laid aside everything telestial of our own free will, by our inspired discipleship, allowing Christ to make the changes in our hearts, minds, and homes, then when the birthing process of the Millennium begins, we will not be subject to the necessary cleansing of the earth as “she” changes. We will still feel the ground shake and watch the trauma of so much cleansing around us, but we will not fear, and we will not be moved but will stand in holy places. Those places will be made holy by our presence—because we, ourselves, are holy. The Holy Spirit will guide us (Doctrine & Covenants 45:56–59), and we will be a source of strength and peace to those around us as the changes occur.

> And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins. For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived—verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day. (Doctrine & Covenants 45:56–57) ([Location 3717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GM5X07M&location=3717))

> The old practitioners of Judaism believed that unrelenting performance of their rituals and sacrifices would save them. They thought that wearing certain robes and observing certain festivals and feasts would save them—no matter the blackness of their hearts or the depth of their unbelief. The same deception could be described as believing that “doing” the Church program can save one. The thinking that years of meeting attendance, temple service, and tithing alone will “earn” one a mansion in the celestial kingdom is not much different from thinking that faithful observance of festivals, feasts, and sacrifices will save you.
