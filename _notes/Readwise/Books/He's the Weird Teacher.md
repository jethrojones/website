> When a child struggles his parents aren’t helping enough at home. You can’t have it both ways. Either you, the teacher, are the final word or you aren’t. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=124))

> Beating everyone else wasn’t the goal. Bettering myself was. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=151))

###### ID 38689891
> He’d ask the question, and then always follow it up with this statement, “Remember, I don’t ask questions unless I know the answer first.” That was probably a lie 50% of the time. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=153))
    - Note: I always say, you know what happens when kids lie to me? I find out the truth. So, just tell me.

> My classroom is not life and death. Just life, the future lives of the children in my care. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=162))
    - Note: Lots of tweetable quotes from @theweirdteacher's book

> Any weakness at any point means two things. One- the next teacher has to go back and shore up that weakness. Two- that shoring-up holds the child back from getting what they need in that grade level. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=165))

###### ID 38689895
> I tell them that when they get in trouble in the lunchroom, that makes me look like a bad teacher. If they act up in the library other adults ask why Mr. Robertson’s class can’t control themselves. Everything falls to me. It means I haven’t taught them correctly. I don’t tell them to tell their parents to help them behave better.

    - Note: @theweirdteacher this is what I ask when my teachers don't do something correctly. Where did I fail?

> We are actors. If I designed a teaching program for a university I would make a beginning acting class a requisite. What are we doing if not acting? The skill sets are very similar. We have to memorize dialogue. We have an audience, possibly with us, possibly hostile, possibly only there to get out of the rain for a while. We have to keep the audience interested in what we have to say. We have to make complicated things comprehensible for the people in the way back of the room. And we have to do the same show over and over without getting bored. Good actors connect with the material. Good teachers might not connect with multiplying fractions, but they know how to make it look like multiplying fractions is an interesting, amazing, important thing.

> There is no simple complaint. Everything must be as dramatic as possible. This cuts down on complaints. You cannot simply say, “Mr. Robertson, that’s a lot of questions.” You have to, and I promise I tell them this, put the back of your hand to your forehead, sigh, and say with proper Dickensian misery, “Mr. Robertson! This is sooo many questions!” To which I’ll reply, “Yes it is. Get to work.” ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=290))

> The key to dealing with expected distractions is to talk to your class. Get them ready for the distraction so it isn’t as novel as it might be. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=400))

> I believe that you cannot be mad at your class for doing something if you didn’t tell them not to do it first. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=404))

> I would feel terrible if, correction- I have felt terrible when I’ve jumped on a child for doing something I didn’t tell them not to do. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=413))

> Children will look at you before they misbehave. They will check in to be sure you aren’t watching. If you can catch that eye you can prevent the behavior. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=421))
    - Note: Yes they do! We call that teacher presence. Knowing when to look at a student. Via @theweirdteacher
    
###### ID 38689905
> I begin setting up these expectations for dealing with distractions immediately. I train my students to sit in their chairs, to roll with changes, to be flexible and understanding. It helps that I am not the most organized teacher in the world. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=436))
    - Note: An excerpt from the book I am reading right now. Organization is very important. But not as important as preparation.

    - Note: Biases, judgmental behavior, bigotry are certainly learned behaviors. @theweirdteacher

> Tell them what you’re going to do. Tell them what you’re doing. Tell them what you did. Tell them explicitly at every step what you expect out of them. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=500))
    - Note: Be explicit in what you expect of others. Via @theweirdteacher

> 1. DON’T PANIC! 2. Remember: They are children. 3. Discipline the behavior, not the child. 4. Your classroom will reflect you, for good or bad. 5. When in doubt- The Beatles. 6. Steal- Others have already taught this. 7. Learn from them, laugh with them. 8. Fear may motivate, but love inspires. 9. They will rise to your expectations, but they may also need a boost. 10. Why blame the parent? You aren’t teaching the parent. 11. Say please and thank you. You are the example now. 12. Sometimes allow yourself to be amazed someone trusts you with all these tiny people. 13. Volunteer to coach, help, and lead. 14. Speak up in meetings, and have faith in your own opinions. Rock the boat. Promote change. 15. Try not to complain about your kids too much. Negativity is sneaky and contagious. 16. Ok, sometimes you can blame the parents. 17. Be prepared and be comfortable. 18. Be able to justify everything you do. 19. Don’t worry, the teacher next door is faking it too.

> I tell them that at the end of the day, if they remain at one check, they will have extra homework which consists of writing one page of sentences relating to what they did to get the check. It isn’t hard. They have to think about the sentence. They have to be responsible. They have to reflect on their behavior. The page is due the next day at the start of the day. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=705))
    - Note: As a (former) English teacher-I cringe when writing is punishment. Help me out here @theweirdteacher

> Of course I yell at my students, but not very often. Real yelling is like an A-Bomb. You can use it, but you can only use it once or twice. If you’re constantly yelling at your class for all manner of problems then they will never be able to tell when you are actually mad and when you’re just being your mean self. When I yell my kids know Serious Things Are Happening. Sometimes I don’t yell. Sometimes, when I’m well and truly angry I will stand in front of my class not saying anything. Staring. For a long long time. Uncomfortably long. Then I’ll speak very quietly about why I’m so mad. Quiet is worse than loud. Quiet is scarier. Quiet is unusual. Quiet can convey anger and disappointment and frustration all at once. All in a look. In a breath. I’ll give them something to do and tell them they need to be silent until I’m feeling better and I’ll sit at my desk to cool off. Can’t do that very often either. Don’t have to. Quietly mad Mr. Robertson is terrifying. I don’t like him either, but he’s there. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=752))
    - Note: Yelling is not bad. Yelling all the time is bad. Quiet is sometimes infinitely more effective.

> Maybe, though, when students have a positive classroom environment, when their teacher believes in reinforcing the good and changing the bad, when they hear praise more often than they hear criticism, they become the class you expect them to be.

> if you’re constantly complaining about a child, then the child is no longer at fault. You, as the teacher, are not doing enough to change their behavior. If the problem is always the same then my first question is- What are you doing about it? If you don’t have a reasonable, flexible answer then you are actually the problem. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=916))

> Sparkle- Sparkle is a spelling game. I much enjoy Sparkle as a way to practice spelling words. In Sparkle everyone stands and I describe a path through the class. It needs to be a simple path, around one group, straight to the next group, and so forth. If you’re a Rows Teacher then up one row, back the next. To play Sparkle I say a spelling word. The student who has been chosen to start says the first letter of that word. The next child says the next letter, and so on. Um, Uh, and Er are not letters. If you say um, uh, or er you have to sit down. If the person in front of you sits down you have to say their letter. This means that the class has to be quiet so everyone knows what the last correct letter said was. There are times when a line of students aren’t paying attention and four or five will fall in a row because one person got a letter wrong and those behind him weren’t paying attention. The word ends not with the last letter, but with the person after the last letter saying, “Sparkle.” That shows they know the word is over. I don’t know why Sparkle is the word that means The End. I stole the game from somewhere and I like the idea of making some of the tough kids happily exclaim, “Sparkle!” ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=1233))

> Connect Four- I don’t explain Connect Four. To introduce it I say, “We are going to play a game. I’m not going to tell you the rules. I’m going to beat you at the game.” Using the overhead I display a grid with the x and y axis labeled. I call out a pair of coordinates, and put a point on those coordinates. I don’t tell them I’m calling coordinates, and the first time we play the game we probably haven’t gone over graphing yet. After I go the first child has to tell me two numbers and I place a point wherever they said to, as long as it’s on the graph. All the clues for how the game works are there from the first move, but it takes a few games for them to figure it out. I beat the class in four moves three or four times. I don’t let them talk to each other so everyone has to puzzle it out by themselves. Three kids in a row might figure it out and build a line- 2, 3; 3, 3; 4, 3. But then the fourth kid still doesn’t understand and veers wildly off the reservation with 7, 8. Once enough of the class has figured it out I split them in half and play them against each other. Every once in awhile I’ll let them challenge me. One person can pretty much always beat a group. One-on-one it’s harder because one person can plan ahead. So I cheat by never playing one-on-one. I’m allowed to cheat. I’m the teacher. By the time we’re done playing I’ve taught my entire class coordinate graphing through a game they’ve enjoyed. They didn’t even realize they were learning a standard. ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EP354C2&location=1244))

> I’m an adult, I have ways to deal with a child trying to wind me up. Their peers have no such toolkit and background. If a teacher takes the aggression of a student personally, that teacher needs to reevaluate why they are feeling that way. You are giving power to a child that a child should not have.
