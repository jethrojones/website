## Highlights
###### ID 38689518
> Don’t generalize; specialize. If you focus on doing one thing well and hire specialists in that area, the quality of your work will improve and you will stand out among your competitors. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=433))
    
###### ID 38689519
> Relying too heavily on one client is risky and will turn off potential buyers. Make sure that no one client makes up more than 15 percent of your revenue. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=440))
    
###### ID 38689520
> Owning a process makes it easier to pitch and puts you in control. Be clear about what you’re selling, and potential customers will be more likely to buy your product. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=514))
    
###### ID 38689521
> Don’t become synonymous with your company. If buyers aren’t confident that your business can run without you in charge, they won’t make their best offer. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=535))
    
###### ID 38689522
> Avoid the cash suck. Once you’ve standardized your service, charge up front or use progress billing to create a positive cash flow cycle. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=566))
    
###### ID 38689523
> Don’t be afraid to say no to projects. Prove that you’re serious about specialization by turning down work that falls outside your area of expertise. The more people you say no to, the more referrals you’ll get to people who need your product or service. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=631))
    
###### ID 38689524
> Take some time to figure out how many pipeline prospects will likely lead to sales. This number will become essential when you go to sell because it allows the buyer to estimate the size of the market opportunity. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=811))
    
###### ID 38689525
> Two sales reps are always better than one. Often competitive types, sales reps will try to outdo each other. And having two on staff will prove to a buyer that you have a scalable sales model, not just one good sales rep. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=823))
    
###### ID 38689526
> Hire people who are good at selling products, not services. These people will be better able to figure out how your product can meet a client’s needs rather than agreeing to customize your offering to fit what the client wants. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=919))
    
###### ID 38689527
> Ignore your profit-and-loss statement in the year you make the switch to a standardized offering even if it means you and your employees will have to forgo a bonus that year. As long as your cash flow remains consistent and strong, you’ll be back in the black in no time. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1034))
    
###### ID 38689528
> You need at least two years of financial statements reflecting your use of the standardized offering model before you sell your company. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1051))
    
###### ID 38689529
> Build a management team and offer them a long-term incentive plan that rewards their personal performance and loyalty. ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1212))
    
###### ID 38689530
> Find an adviser for whom you will be neither their largest nor their smallest client. Make sure they know your industry. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1329))
    
###### ID 38689531
> Avoid an adviser who offers to broker a discussion with a single client. You want to ensure there is competition for your business and avoid being used as a pawn for your adviser to curry favor with his or her best client. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1401))
    
###### ID 38689532
> Think big. Write a three-year business plan that paints a picture of what is possible for your business. Remember, the company that acquires you will have more resources for you to accelerate your growth. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1445))
    
###### ID 38689533
> If you want to be a sellable, product-oriented business, you need to use the language of one. Change words like “clients” to “customers” and “firm” to “business.” Rid your Web site and customerfacing communications of any references that reveal you used to be a generic service business. ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1517))
    
###### ID 38689534
> Don’t issue stock options to retain key employees after an acquisition. Instead, use a simple stay bonus that offers the members of your management team a cash reward if you sell your company. Pay the reward in two or more installments only to those who stay so that you ensure your key staff stays on through the transition. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IYISQW&location=1598))
