> Once the soul awakens, the search begins and you can never go back. From then on, you are inflamed with a special longing that will never again let you linger in the lowlands of complacency and partial fulfillment. The eternal makes you urgent. You are loath to let compromise or the threat of danger hold you back from striving toward the summit of fulfillment. —John O’Donohue ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083S4DZ2H&location=58))

###### ID 234484313
> The level of the solution is never found at the level of the problem. Knowing this, you can escape many traps that people fall into. What exists at the level of the problem? Repetitive thinking that gets nowhere. Old conditioning that keeps applying yesterday’s outworn choices. Lots of obsessive thinking and stalled action. I could go on. But the relevant insight is that you have more than one level of awareness, and at a deeper level there is untapped creativity and insight. —Deepak Chopra ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083S4DZ2H&location=272))

###### ID 234484315
> We can apply this knowledge in a couple of different ways. First, it helps us understand that by improving our mindsets, we can improve our thinking, learning, and behavior and thus our success across our life, work, and leadership. Second, referencing the Deepak Chopra quote at the beginning of this chapter: “The level of the solution is never found at the level of the problem.” So, this pyramid suggests that if our current thinking, learning, and behaviors are not generating the success we want, we need to shift our focus from “fixing” or changing our thinking, learning, and behaviors to the level below: our mindsets.

###### ID 234484317

When we wed a future, we break with convention. We begin to engage in unconventional actions and a new future begins to emerge. When we are purpose driven we are still influenced by our past but we are no longer prisoners. We integrate knowledge with desire and it takes us off the path of least resistance. We move from problem solving to purpose finding. This gives rise to learning and creation. ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083S4DZ2H&location=2855))
