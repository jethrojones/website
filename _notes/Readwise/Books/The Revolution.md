> Many of the things we value and think are the most important in school are things we have inherited through the years and become very accustomed to. As a result, we have associated school with these traditions. We spend a lot of time building up these systems and practices (e.g., the school schedule, covering content, rigid behavioral expectations for learning environments), and our intense focus on these areas has made us beholden to them to the extent that we prioritize them over what matters most in our schools.

    - Note: our ingtense focus on the traditions has made us beholdden to them! powerful!

> Revolution@ries don’t limit themselves to the traditional use of spaces—they see opportunities! They can completely reimagine their learning spaces by bringing in more color to stimulate creativity in the middle school brain (How’s that for contradictory thinking?), tearing down walls, removing lockers, and making changes to give students space to do revolution@ry work!
