> Truth is the heart of comedy. We laugh at what we recognize. At the same time, truth coupled with pain and not enough distance may come across as insensitive, hurtful, or offensive. Pain can be physical or emotional. It can range from a moment of mild embarrassment or awkwardness to severe tragedy or trauma. (Libera defines pain more broadly to include elements like taboo, risk, and cognitive dissonance, but for our purposes, just know that this dimension usually involves some level of discomfort.) In some cases, finding the humor in our pain can be cathartic; in others, it can bring up old feelings we’d rather not relive. Distance is a measure of how far an individual or group of people is from the subject of your humor. It can be temporal (“too soon” to laugh about something), geographic (whether something happened to me or my neighbor versus someone halfway across the world), or psychological (how relevant something is to our personal experience).
