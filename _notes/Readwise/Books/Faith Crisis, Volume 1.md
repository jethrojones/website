> All history writing consists of the following: The existence of pieces of individual physical data such as memories, documents, pictures, artifacts, historic sites. Selection, interpretation and evaluation of those pieces of data by the historian. The invention of a narrative that connects, makes “sense” of the data gathered by the historian. A frame, a metaphysical construct which builds an account of the unseen world and is the frame of reference for all statements of the historian.

> Thus all historical accounts are the invention of the author, made up. The name for things made up is “fiction,” a word that derives from the Latin “facare,” to make or to do. Thus all history is fiction, some better, some worse. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LX67N9S&location=97))

> President Ezra Taft Benson, after careful review by Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson,1 summed up our current academic atmosphere solemnly in these words: The world worships the learning of man. They trust in the arm of flesh (see D&C 1:19). To them, men’s reasoning is greater than God’s revelations. The precepts of man have gone so far in subverting our educational system that in many cases a higher degree today, in the so-called social sciences, can be tantamount to a major investment in error. Very few men build firmly enough on the rock of revelation to go through this kind of indoctrination and come out untainted. Unfortunately, of those who succumb, some use their higher degree to get teaching positions even in our Church Educational System, where they spread the falsehoods they have been taught.

> The truth is, the foundation laid down by the Prophet Joseph Smith is built upon the Rock that can never fail. If the structure being built is in crisis, could it be that those building are now constructing on a new foundation—a new history, a new narrative—all of sand?

###### ID 547330736
> Traditionalists saw God’s hand in and throughout history, and they strove to interpret the past, the present, and the future through a divine lens. For them, truth was not relative and did not evolve over time. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LX67N9S&location=462))

###### ID 547330738
> In 1976, President Ezra Taft Benson challenged New Mormon History and other revisionist history movements in America. “Secular scholarship, though useful, provides an incomplete and sometimes inaccurate view of our history. . . . we have become self-sufficient. This has given birth to a new religion in America which some have called secularism. This is a view of life without the idea that God is in the picture or that He had anything to do with the picture in the first place. . . . “Historians and educational writers who are responsible for this movement are classified as “revisionists.” Their purpose has been and is to create a ‘new history.’ By their own admission, they are more influenced by their own training and other humanistic and scientific disciplines than any religious conviction. This detachment provides them, they say, with an objectivity that the older historians did not have. Many of the older historians, I should point out, were defenders of the patriots and their noble efforts. Feeling no obligation to perpetuate the ideals of the founding fathers, some of the so-called “new historians” have recast a new body of beliefs for their secular faith. Their efforts, in some cases, have resulted in a new interpretation of our nation’s history.” Ezra Taft Benson, "God’s Hand in Our Nation’s History," Brigham Young University Devotional, March 28, 1977, https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/ezra-taft-benson/gods-hand-nations-history/.

However, Elder McConkie had not needed that confirmation; he already knew, as he utilized another measuring stick for truth—doctrine, and revelation.

###### ID 547330741
> While Bruce R. McConkie employed his doctrinal knowledge and familiarity with scripture to evaluate Hofmann’s find, it must be stressed that this was not doctrine he had merely intellectually studied; it was doctrine that he comprehended by revelation.

> Brigham Young spoke of the importance of the Spirit in detecting truth from error when he taught: I have proven to my satisfaction, according to the best knowledge I can gather, that man can be deceived by the sight of the natural eye, he can be deceived by the hearing of the ear, and by the touch of the hand; that he can be deceived in all of what are called the natural senses. But there is one thing in which he cannot be deceived. What is that? It is the operations of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit and power of God upon the creature.

> Many advocates of the progressive viewpoint misinterpret statements such as Brigham Young’s, as traditionalists willing to throw out logic, science, and reason, for feelings, goosebumps and sensations. Nothing could be further from the truth. When a person speaks of revelation, they are not speaking of emotion only, but of communication through the Spirit.

###### ID 547330749
> I have given some thought to this question, and the answer thereto so far as I can determine, is: We can tell when the speakers are “moved upon by the Holy Ghost” only when we, ourselves, are “moved upon by the Holy Ghost.” In a way, this completely shifts the responsibility from them to us to determine when they so speak.

Though there are actually a couple of plausible decisions one could take (in light of evidence from the book itself and from history) of when the Book of Moses may have actually been written.
