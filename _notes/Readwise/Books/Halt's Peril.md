> The healer had personal knowledge of Horace’s courage, and he knew this fear of dark, confined spaces had nothing to do with physical bravery. It was something locked deep in Horace’s mind—perhaps some incident in early childhood that he had long forgotten. Knowing this, he recognized the real courage that Horace was showing in overcoming his fear. ([Location 5047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003YL4AMQ&location=5047))
