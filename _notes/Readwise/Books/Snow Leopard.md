> When these people scroll through their social media feeds, they are (usually) not looking to be challenged. Instead, they are in a state of searching for confirmation bias. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B7Z7RT86&location=60))

Level 1: Consumption Level 2: Curation Level 3: Obvious Connection Level 4: Non-Obvious Connection Level 5: Category Creation ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B7Z7RT86&location=97))
    
###### ID 440939295
> In fact, as a rule of thumb: people with giant audiences online tend to create the most surface-level, Obvious, content-free content. Whereas the people with smaller, more niche audiences tend to create Non-Obvious, hyper-relevant content. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B7Z7RT86&location=153))
    
###### ID 440939296
> Non-Obvious Connectors are writers, creators, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders who change the world with their thinking. The unfortunate part, however, is that data shows us most people don’t want their thinking changed. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B7Z7RT86&location=263))

> Your “burn rate” is the amount of money it costs to sustain your lifestyle of happy living. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B7Z7RT86&location=380))
    
###### ID 440939301

###### ID 440939304
> If you want short-term money, then create Obvious content. If you want long-term dividends, then create Non-Obvious content (your library will last longer). ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B7Z7RT86&location=551))
    
###### ID 440939305
> If the education world wants to produce more creators in society, it needs to fix their ratio of reading versus writing—input vs output—and move generations of consumers up The Content Pyramid. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B7Z7RT86&location=628))

###### ID 440939310
