###### ID 38688938
> Sometimes, even though you’re “in charge,” you need to be aware that in the moment you might have nothing to add, and so you don’t wade in. You trust your people to do their jobs and focus your energies on some other pressing issue. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=113))
