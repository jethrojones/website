## Highlights
###### ID 665354803
> We will support the knowing (the head) of what we mean by character and its development and education. We will emphasize the ways we have to be (the heart) with each other and especially students to optimally nurture the flourishing of character. And we will emphasize what we have to do (the hand) as character educators. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=289))
    - Note: Nice way to lay out what the topic requires
    
###### ID 665354804
> Prioritizing character in the school; intentionally building healthy Relationships among all stakeholders; using Intrinsic motivators so students Internalize the core values of the school; Modeling the character you want students to develop; Empowering all stakeholders to be co-owners and co-authors of the journey; and taking a long-term Developmental perspective on the character goals and methods in the school. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=301))
    
###### ID 665354805
> “Leadership is a matter of how to be, not how to do” ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=320))
    - Note: [[leadership]]
    
###### ID 665354806
> All too often, people want to jump right to new ways of doing. They do this by asking for methods, curricula, lesson plans, and programs for character education. In essence, they skip right past the critical task of changing oneself as an educator, that is, of transforming one’s way of being as foundational to effectively doing. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=325))
    - Note: People try to academize everything even when it is not wise to academize it.
    
###### ID 665354807
> Aristotle argued that transforming habits (doing) early in life creates the foundation for the later development of virtues (being). ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=328))
    - Note: [[discipline]]
    
###### ID 665354808
> According to Puett and Gross-Loh, Confucian goodness is not something you can define in the abstract. It’s the ability to respond well to others; the development of the sensibility that enables you to behave in ways that are good for those around you and draw out their own better sides. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=334))
    
###### ID 665354809
> Give self-centered teenagers real responsibilities in a face-to-face service learning project where they can see and feel how they are making a difference in the life of a needy child or a vulnerable senior citizen and that experience can, for those teens, change their sense of efficacy, sense of purpose, and moral identity—the very core of their being. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=353))
    - Note: The opportunities kids have to reflect on their own experience in the world is exceptionally valuable.
    
###### ID 665354810
> I use the notions of organic vs. mechanical concepts, metaphors, and terminology. So much of what we say and do in education is framed in terms of mechanics. We teach. We transfer knowledge. We control behavior. We manage classrooms. We engineer school change. And so on. Instead, I want to hear us talking about and enacting more organic processes. We should nurture learning and development. We should foster understanding and human flourishing. We should educate for character. Humans are organic entities. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=365))
    - Note: Marvin uses organic to describe soft skills and mechanistic to describe hard skills. That seems pretty apt.
    
###### ID 665354811
> Schools make the mechanical mistake all the time. They look for a set of lessons, a curriculum, an assembly on bullying or some other special event that will “teach” character. As we will discover later, this is not how character develops. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=384))
    - Note: We rush to this solution more than we like to admit.
    
###### ID 665354812
> As David Brooks, the New York Times columnist and author, wrote, “Social transformation follows personal transformation.” ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=390))
    - Note: If we want society to change, we need to focus on changing ourselves, then our families! We cannot overcome the culture taught in the home, whether that is taught directly or indirectly.
    
###### ID 665354813
> changes in doing, in educational practices and strategies, are far less impactful than changes in who you are as a person and educator. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=397))
    - Note: Changes in our strategies will only take us so far. When i wanted to lose weight, i lost a lot of weight from changing my diet. But as soon as i changed mhsef, the weight stayed off.
    
###### ID 665354814
> Every problem is an opportunity in disguise. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=402))
    - Note: [[positive intelligence]]
    
###### ID 665354815
> Amy Johnston was an exemplary character education principal (who led Francis Howell Middle School to recognition as a National School of Character) and since has earned her doctorate in character education and works for Character.org, CharacterPlus, and the University of Missouri-St. Louis’ Center for Character and Citizenship. She recounts the story of when FHMS first started seeing not only the behavioral and developmental results of thoughtful character education but also the (almost inevitable) corresponding academic gains. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=431))
    - Note: Would be good to interview on Transformative Principal
    
###### ID 665354816
> The impressive new building for the US Air Force Academy’s Center for Character and Leadership Development is named Polaris Hall. The idea was to use the North Star as a guiding symbol for its name and its design. Navigators have long used the North Star as a constant guide for keeping their journeys on course. In fact, when you sit in the defendant’s chair in the USAFA Honor Courtroom, you are sitting under a magnificent glass ocular tower that always points to the North Star. It is remarkably clever, meaningful, and symbolic. For character education, human goodness serves as the North Star. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=522))
    - Note: A north star is a powerful symbol because it is not the destination. It is a thing you use to know if you are on the right path or not.
    
###### ID 665354817
> In the same room, one person voiced concern that character education was a liberal move to counter traditional religious and cultural values, and another voiced a concern that it is a conservative Christian movement to sneak religious values into liberal public schools. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=564))
    - Note: This is why in my opinion we need to let the students and their families decide what their own values are and use that as a discussion point for how to navigate society when people disagree.
    
###### ID 665354818
> think morality is the single most important aspect of character. David Shields, in a 2011 article in the Phi Delta Kappan, identified five subcategories of character: Moral, performance, intellectual, civic, and collective. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=587))
    - Note: Most questions of morality we can almost all agree upon. Though there are some sricky wickets, many of them also dont matter in the grand scheme of things
    
###### ID 665354819
> it is about right and wrong and includes knowledge of what is right and wrong, the motivation to try to do what is right, and the skills and other capacities required to act in ways that maximize morality. Moral character involves the knowledge, motives, and competencies that lead to actions that by their nature directly impact the well-being and rights of others. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=600))
    - Note: Morality is about right amd wrong. But what if we didn't judge as much?
    
###### ID 665354820
> Performance character is about the inclination and capacity to do the best one can at whatever one is doing. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=607))
    - Note: It is my belief that we are always doing the best we can in a given moment. This is a blameless discernment of what is happening in our lives. If we could actualy do better in the moment, we would.
    
###### ID 665354821
> As Aristotle used it, “virtue” meant “human excellence”—being excellent at being human, at being what Aristotle believed human beings are naturally meant to be if they wish to be happy, namely, morally good! In this Aristotelian sense, there is an intrinsic goodness to excellence; it is not a separate quality added on to goodness. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=623))
    - Note: The way i define this is the Light of Christ.
    
###### ID 665354822
> civic character includes the pursuit of the common good, with good including not only what is needed but also what is right. It also entails respect for truth, something we should not take for granted in the current political and cultural climate of “new truth,” “alternative truth,” etc. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=631))
    - Note: A respect for truth is also vital
    
###### ID 665354823
> as the Founding Fathers of the United States of America recognized, the primary reason for universal schooling was the cultivation of democratic citizens. Schooling was not viewed by them as career development but rather as citizen development, a perspective that has largely been lost over the last two centuries. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=637))
    - Note: Career deveopment is short sighted especially today as so many people change careers over the course of their working lives.
    
###### ID 665354824
> So we can see that character is the set of characteristics that motivate and enable one to act as a moral agent (moral character), do one’s best work (performance character), effectively collaborate in the common space to promote the common good (civic character), and effectively inquire about and pursue knowledge and truth (intellectual character). ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=643))
    
###### ID 665354825
> Tikkun Olam. It is trying to make the world a better place for everyone. So human goodness is the set of psychological characteristics that motivate and enable one to be add ethical value to the world. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=659))
    
###### ID 665354826
> Character is an aspect of the nature of the person, character development consists of the psychological processes that bring about the growth of character, and character education is the intentional nurturing of those developmental processes through the practices of families, schools, and other contexts. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=675))
    
###### ID 665354827
> It seems they knew intellectually where the keys were, but, when it came to implementation, they ran to the street light. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=724))
    - Note: Educators are often trying to academize and make things work in their schema, (which often includes measurable outcomes) rather thandoing what they know is right, but may not have the "data" to "prove" it is right.
    
###### ID 665354828
> Heraclitus, the classic Greek philosopher who lived over 2,500 years ago, said that “Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed to develop good character.” ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=792))
    - Note: Good character is developed over time. Often, it is the mistakes we make nd the times we did not show up how we would like to tha are our greatest teachers.
      this is one reason it is important to show up every day. These lessons cannot be sped up, only learned over time, day by day amd little by little, whch is why getting a little bit better every day is so important.
    
###### ID 665354829
> According to Aristotle (who lived about a century after Heraclitus), flourishing is the highest achievement of human development (he called it Eudaimonia). ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=798))
    
###### ID 665354830
> logic models should state their (1) desired outcome goals (remember “Backward design”?); (2) their intervention strategies (what they propose to do to produce those outcomes); and (3) the relations between the two sets, including a convincing justification of why the interventions should be expected to result in the desired outcomes. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=885))
    - Note: I should remember this term Logic Model. I am sure it will come up again
    
###### ID 665354831
> principal Kristen Pelster, after taking the helm of Ridgewood Middle School, asked candidates for teaching positions only about relationships and classroom management and never about content expertise. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=998))
    - Note: You’re hiring practices and the questions you ask need to focus on the things that you truly value. 
      Too many schools do things because they “have to” but that is not a good enough reason to do things. Truly, you probably don’t have to actually do that thing. 
      At Canyons school district the questions we asked in interviews were more scripted than in other places. That wasn’t effective.
    
###### ID 665354832
> Despite the oft-perceived tension between focusing on academic achievement and focusing on character development, there is strong evidence of the synergy between these two purposes of education. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1002))
    - Note: Oft-perceived is the right phrase. It is perceived, but not true. Being good helps you improve in every other area as well. 
      It’s hard to be a good human, working towards excellence and be satisfied with mediocrity in any other area.
    
###### ID 665354833
> The data suggest that adolescents feel less than amorous about their schools—and for good reason; so many middle and high schools are not structured to help students flourish. At a time in their lives when they need more, not less, active engagement, classes often make them largely passive learners who have to listen to teachers talk at them most of the day. However, if you do effective character education well, such as by following the Six Design Principles of PRIMED, even teenagers are likely to enjoy school, perhaps even emotionally bond to or love their schools. ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1039))
    - Note: Schools are not designed for kids. They are designed for adults. And until they are designed for kids, kids will continue to love learning and hate school.
    
###### ID 665354834
> through character education RMS went from a failing-in-every-respect school to a National School of Character in only six years. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1045))
    - Note: They were great because we said they are great. Who awards the “National School of character”?
    
###### ID 665354835
> their percentage of students meeting state standards went from 7% in math and 30% in communication arts to about 70% in each. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1046))
    - Note: 70% proficient still means 30% are FAILING. while that might be great for the 70 percent, it’s not great for the 30%
    
###### ID 665354836
> An interesting sidelight is that the administrative team of Tim Crutchley and Kristen Pelster intentionally did not even use the term “character education” during the first three years but just went about crafting a new way of being that was relational and trusting and child-centered. Then they named it. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1047))
    - Note: This is a powerful example of how it really is about a way of being, not necessarily about the doing. Create it, then name it. 
      That’s how you know it is really a way of being.
    
###### ID 665354837
> Character education, understood as an essential end in itself—is, in my mind, THE most important goal of schooling—and for that matter, parenting as well. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1067))
    - Note: Character education is the only education that matters or that even sticks with us.
    
###### ID 665354838
> There are five kinds of Prioritization practices, each of which will be treated separately in their own chapters: (1) rhetoric, (2) resource allocation, (3) school climate/culture, (4) structures, and (5) leadership. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1085))
    
###### ID 665354839
> “Talking about” (both in speech and in writing) is typically the first step that schools take in their journeys to implement character education. One pejorative phrase used to ridicule character education is that it is merely “words on the wall.” Many schools quickly purchase or produce character-focused posters and other graphic images and proudly display them in hallways, classrooms, and public areas like the cafeteria or gymnasium. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1097))
    - Note: Wasting space posters and words if we do not act in accordamce wth those ideals is just thag: a waste.
    
###### ID 665354840
> If there is no implementation that goes beyond simply promoting the importance of character, then rhetorical emphasis is as pointless as highlighting a blank page. Therefore, Rhetorical Prioritization as a first step might actually be pointless. In fact, it can be harmful, especially for adolescents. Adolescents need no help being skeptical, even cynical. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1106))
    - Note: This shows the value of naming what exists, rather than speaking something into existence.
    
###### ID 665354841
> If we profess something with our lips but do not sincerely mean it in our hearts, then we are guilty of being intentional hypocrites. But quite often, the gap between what we espouse and what we do is not because we are being intentionally deceptive. Rather it is because we do not see the gap between what we claim (espoused theory) and what we actually do (theory in action). We think we are prioritizing character education in what we really do but are blind to the fact that we really are not. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1116))
    - Note: I would say that in many more cases than not, it is ignorance not intentional deception.
    
###### ID 665354842
> When Wolfgang Althof established a series of character education schools in Switzerland, he urged schools to wait until they had fully developed their initiatives before they wrote their mission statements. His reasoning was that “it is much easier to find the right words if you just have to write up what already is an informed consensus. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1121))
    - Note: When you speak the truth, you do not stumble or missspeak, because you are being true to yourself and it is easier to keep track of what you know than what you have to remember.
      as a side note we should all be so lucky to know this truth.
      the things we learn spiritually, or in character education are things never to be forgotten.
    
###### ID 676352518
> People tend to take better care of things for which they feel some sense of ownership. After all, when was the last time you changed the oil in a rental car or moved the furniture and vacuumed in a hotel room? ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1159))
    - Note: Are we just takimg up space in a school as my kids' principal one time confessed toe, or do we take ownership in the place while we are there. Perhaps a truer question of character is do you still male your bed when you get out of a hotel bed in the morning?
    
###### ID 676352519
> I have found that the five that are usually part of any list are some versions of respect, responsibility, fairness, honesty, and compassion. These also are the words at the core of the Six Pillars of Character from Character Counts and the core concepts from the Institute for Global Ethics, both of which used broad constituencies to identify what they consider a universal set of values. ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1185))
    
###### ID 676352520
> It is a wise idea to build into the historical rhythms of the school a regular review of those values. At least every six years in the K-5 schools, three years in the middle school, four years in the high school, etc. you should have a process for revisiting the values. ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1193))
    - Note: This is wise. I would say it is worthwhile as a way of teaching to shre and review the values yearly in a middle school
    
###### ID 680516004
> This suggests that the professional development of the principal should emphasize character education expertise, which is why I have invested so much time, energy, and resources in the Leadership Academy in Character Education (more on this later) for the past two decades. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1691))
    - Note: I am doing my research on the pd of the principal, and i am having a hard time finding research about PD for principals as most of it is about PD for teachers led by the principal.

###### ID 680516009
> My colleague, Melinda Bier, has, with the generous support of the John Templeton Foundation, studied the various renderings of servant leadership and narrowed down the core list of virtues of the servant leaders to the following set: Noble purpose; courage; humility; forgiveness; gratitude; foresight; empowerment; and stewardship.

([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1736))
    
###### ID 680516011
> Effective leaders have to ask themselves if there is a noble purpose behind their work. Are you called to do what you do? Does it serve the greater good? What is your noble purpose? Noble purpose is a purpose that seeks the good and looks beyond what is good for the self to good that serves others and the world in which we live. ([Location 1744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1744))
    
###### ID 680516012
> The second inner strength is humility. Humility does not mean self-deprecation. Rather it entails understanding one’s own strengths along with one’s weaknesses. It is about accurate self-assessment. ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1748))
    
###### ID 680516013
> The third inner strength is benevolence. I struggled with where to place benevolence. Megan Tschannen-Moran includes it as a trust-building characteristic, so it could easily go in the third cluster: Relationships and trustworthiness. I put it as an inner strength because the core of it is a caring attitude, or what Clifton Taulbert calls a nurturing attitude in Eight Habits of the Heart. ([Location 1758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1758))
    
###### ID 680516014
> The fourth inner strength is ethical. People vary in the degree to which morality or ethics is central to them. This too is a factor in trustworthiness, ([Location 1769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1769))
    
###### ID 680516015
> The fifth inner strength is moral courage. Ethical means school leaders need to be driven by a clear commitment to ethics and morality. But often there are obstacles to doing the right thing. Therefore, they also need the courage to do the right thing in the face of fear and threats and other obstacles. ([Location 1774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XK8YZ4N&location=1774))

> “the commons dilemma.” A small group of people is told that they are residents in a hypothetical town and that their food is limited to the fish in the local pond. They are told that if they collectively take no more than 15 fish a day, the fish will continue to populate the pond, but if they collectively take more than 15, then the population of fish will decline until there is no more food for their children and grandchildren, etc. Then each person privately “fishes”; that is, each individual indicates how many fish he or she will take the first day. And the next. And the next. In very few cycles, most groups exhaust all the fish and wipe out the entire town, if not for their generation, then for the next. This is the opposite of stewardship and clearly relates to many environmental challenges we are all facing.

    - Note: This screams the need for unstructured time to engage in non-academic activities where adults and students are engaged. This is my main argument for why clubs and sports should be part of the school day and open opportunities for more kids and more adults to be involved. When we made this change at our school, every adult in the building except for the head secretary was involved in a group of students working in something meaningful but non-academic. The custodian, staff, administration, counselors. All were involved.

    - Note: Good story until this point. This is an example of doing the right things for the wrong reasons. Instead, tell the kids what matters, building relationships, and focus on that. You’re writing a biography of me, because us having a relationship is important. By the end of the year, I, as your teacher will write a biography of you as well. Imagine how powerful that would be. So much more than “academic credit”.

Students reported that they were actually only around 20% where they identified an adult. When the adults said they were at 90-95%. Eventually they did get student reported responses in the 90-95% range. {{citation needed}}
