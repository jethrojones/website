## Highlights
###### ID 234481476
> This book identifies these idea pathogens, discusses their spread from the universities to all walks of life including politics, business, and popular culture, and offers ways to inoculate ourselves from their devastating effects.

### CHAPTER ONE From Civil War to the Battle of Ideas
###### ID 234481477
> Existential genocidal hatred is not something that one magically and suddenly contracts as an adult; rather, it is instilled insidiously and repeatedly in the minds of otherwise pure and innocent children. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=156))
    
###### ID 234481478
> While I concede that parents do wield sizeable influence in shaping their offspring, psychoanalytic theories overestimate such forces while ignoring the unique combination of genes that defines an individual. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=241))
    
###### ID 234481479
> In my forties, my father shared with me his deep regret that I did not receive a Jewish education. I told him that I was thankful that he had not forced such an education on me. My friendships and romantic interests have spanned races, ethnicities, and religions, and I am richer for it. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=254))
    
###### ID 234481480
> Many professors forget that their professional responsibility is not only to generate new knowledge but also to seek to maximally disseminate it. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=281))
    
###### ID 234481481
> The quest for truth should always supersede one’s ego-defensive desire to be proven right. This is not an easy task because for most people it is difficult to admit to being wrong. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=299))

###### ID 234481483
> Every quality that should define intellectual courage is viewed as a problem. Anything that adheres to leftist tenets of progressivism is rewarded. Those who believe in equality of outcomes receive top-paying administrative jobs. Those who believe in meritocracy are frowned upon. If they go unchecked, parasitic idea pathogens, spawned by universities, eventually start to infect every aspect of our society.

> parasitic pathogens of the human mind. These are composed of thought patterns, belief systems, attitudes, and mindsets that parasitize one’s ability to think properly and accurately. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=384))
    
###### ID 234481485
> Once these mind viruses take hold of one’s neuronal circuitry, the afflicted victim loses the ability to use reason, logic, and science to navigate the world. Instead, one sinks into an abyss of infinite lunacy best defined by a dogged and proud departure from reality, common sense, and truth. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=386))
    
###### ID 234481486
> In the same way that brain parasites have evolved to take advantage of their hosts in the furtherance of their evolutionary objectives, parasitic viruses of the human mind (devastatingly bad ideas) function in a similar manner. They parasitize human minds, rendering them impervious to critical thinking, while finding clever ways to spread across a given population (for example, getting students to enroll in women’s studies departments). ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=399))
    
###### ID 234481487
> While each mind virus constitutes a different strain of lunacy, they are all bound by the full rejection of reality and common sense (postmodernism rejects the existence of objective truths; radical feminism scoffs at the idea of innate biologically-based sex differences; and social constructivism posits that the human mind starts off as an empty slate largely void of biological blueprints). ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=404))
    
###### ID 234481488
> This general class of mind viruses is what I have coined Ostrich Parasitic Syndrome (OPS), namely various forms of disordered thinking that lead afflicted individuals to reject fundamental truths and realities that are as evident as the pull of gravity. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=407))
    
###### ID 234481489
> In a similar vein to how all forms of cancer share a mechanism of unchecked cell division, these mind viruses all reject truth in the defense of a pet ideology. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=408))
    
###### ID 234481490
> The inoculation against such cancerous mindsets comes in the form of a two-step cognitive vaccine: 1) providing OPS sufferers with accurate information, and 2) ensuring that OPS sufferers learn how to process information according to the evidentiary rules of science and logic.

### CHAPTER TWO Thinking versus Feeling, Truth versus Hurt Feelings
###### ID 234481492
> The challenge is to know when to activate the cognitive (thinking) versus the affective (feeling) systems. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=481))
    
###### ID 234481493
> The Elaboration Likelihood Model posits that consumers use one of two routes of persuasion when processing a message.7 The central route involves cognitive effort, namely the consumer will carefully evaluate the message’s substantive informational content (such as the seven reasons why a particular mutual fund is the best one to invest in). ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=490))
    
###### ID 234481494
> The peripheral route on the other hand relies on the use of non-substantive cues in arriving at an attitude (using an endorser’s physical attractiveness in forming an attitude toward investing in a mutual fund). ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=493))
    
###### ID 234481495
> The negative hysteria surrounding Donald Trump is rooted in peripheral processing (“his mannerisms disgust me”). ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=497))
    
###### ID 234481496
> Inherent to the various sequences is the recognition that both cognition and emotions matter in the decision-making process. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=504))
    
###### ID 234481497
> Problems arise when we use the wrong sequence to make a decision. For example, choosing which presidential candidate to vote for should be construed as a high-involvement decision, and accordingly a rational voter should first engage his cognitive system rather than his affective system. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=506))
    
###### ID 234481498
> It seems self-evident to me that it is perfectly rational to be an emotional being, when one’s emotions are applied in the proper context. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=517))
    
###### ID 234481499
> The problem arises when domains that should be reserved for the intellect are hijacked by feelings. This is precisely what plagues our universities: what were once centers of intellectual development have become retreats for the emotionally fragile. The driving motto of the university is no longer the pursuit of truth but the coddling of hurt feelings. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=530))
    
###### ID 234481500
> And yet, across all our institutions—from universities to the media to the judicial system to the political arena—truth is increasingly taking a back seat to feelings. This is true in the United States, it is true in Canada, and it is true across most of the western world. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=537))
    
###### ID 234481501
> There are two fundamental ethical orientations that guide people’s daily behaviors: deontological and consequentialist ethics. The former is an absolutist view of ethical standards (it is never correct to lie) whereas the latter evaluates the ethical merits of an action based on its consequences (it is at times acceptable to lie to spare someone’s feelings). ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=562))
    - Note: [[The Conscience Code]]
    
###### ID 234481502
> His righteous indignation and justifiable disgust were not attributed to the situation at hand but were wrongly placed on the shoulders of his innate character. This is precisely what psychologists refer to as the fundamental attribution error, namely exaggerating the extent to which an individual’s internal traits (his personality) are responsible for an observed reality while failing to take the circumstances into account. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=630))
    
###### ID 234481503
> My personality does not magically change across the two scenarios; the situation does. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=642))
    
###### ID 234481504
> In a ploy that would make Sigmund Freud beam with pride, the Democrats managed to project their emotional hysteria onto Kavanaugh. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=644))
    
###### ID 234481505
> Clear-thinking people know that there is a place for both emotions and intellect, for humor and seriousness, and understand when to activate their emotional versus cognitive systems as they navigate life. But people who have fallen prey to idea pathogens have lost control of their minds and their emotions—and those pathogens are spreading rapidly and threatening our freedom. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=751))
    
### CHAPTER THREE Non-Negotiable Elements of a Free and Modern Society
###### ID 234481506
> In this chapter, I offer a more distilled set of factors. I posit that the guaranteed right to debate any idea (freedom of speech and thought) coupled with a commitment to reason and science to test competing ideas (the scientific method) are what have made Western Civilization great. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=764))
    
###### ID 234481507
> Two passages from an article Rushdie wrote in 2005 make the succinct case for freedom of speech. “The idea that any kind of free society can be constructed in which people will never be offended or insulted, or in which they have the right to call on the law to defend them against being offended or insulted, is absurd.” Moreover: “The moment you say that an idea system is sacred, whether it’s a religious belief system or a secular ideology, the moment you declare a set of ideas to be immune from criticism, satire, derision, or contempt, freedom of thought becomes impossible.” ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=860))
    
###### ID 234481508
> If you truly understand the meaning of free speech, then you must agree with the following: “There is simply no better alternative than to allow those with unpopular views to express them and to allow those wishing to hear them to do so.” ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=894))
    
###### ID 234481509
> No! Freedom of speech is precisely meant to protect the most obnoxious, offensive, and disgusting speech. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=899))
    
###### ID 234481510
> Whatever cannot stand satire is false.” ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=923))
    
###### ID 234481511
> “Satire should, like a polished razor keen, / Wound with a touch that’s scarcely felt or seen.”14 ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=928))
    
###### ID 234481512
> All satire aside, science is liberating precisely because it does not care about your identity. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1002))
    
###### ID 234481513
> According to such a view, the scientific method is only one of many ways of knowing. Other forms of knowing, including those that might belong within the folklore and mythology of indigenous people, are peddled as equally valid forms of discovery. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1011))
    
###### ID 234481514
> All claims about the natural world must pass through the evidentiary prism of the scientific method. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1021))
    
###### ID 234481515
> Ludwig von Mises, a leading figure of the Austrian School of Economics and a staunch defender of classical liberalism, coined the term polylogism to capture this exact folly. Mises differentiated between Marxian polylogism and racial polylogism. In the former case, an individual’s method of thinking was determined by his social class while in the latter case, race was the guiding factor. Mises was well aware of the illogical nature of this premise when he remarked: “A consistent supporter of polylogism would have to maintain that ideas are correct because their author is a member of the right class, nation, or race. But consistency is not one of their virtues. Thus the Marxians are prepared to assign the epithet ‘proletarian thinker’ to everybody whose doctrines they approve. All the others they disparage either as foes of their class or as social traitors.” ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1057))
    
###### ID 234481516
> How do the DIE bureaucrats impose conformity? In the academic world, you are free to dress as you’d like, but your thoughts and beliefs are subject to the intellectual conformity of the progressive ideology. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1120))
    
###### ID 234481517
> The economist Thomas Sowell, who happens to be one of the original slayers of social justice warriors back in the 1960s and 1970s, famously quipped: “The next time some academics tell you how important ‘diversity’ is, ask how many Republicans there are in their sociology department.”40 ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1137))
    
###### ID 234481518
> The “academics are smart and hence they are liberals” premise is faulty for a second reason. The implicit but erroneous implication is that conservatives are largely science deniers. But science denialism is found amongst liberals at least as much as it is amongst conservatives. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1159))
    
###### ID 234481519

###### ID 234481520
> An analysis of political campaign donations across a broad range of industries uncovered that the four most liberal professions, in decreasing order, were the entertainment industry, academia, online computer services, and newspapers and print media.45 These professions were much more liberal than conservative professions were conservative. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0853F4VKP&location=1178))
    
###### ID 234481521
> I end this chapter with a very poignant quote from Ronald Reagan, uttered nearly two decades before he became president of the United States: But freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. The only way they can inherit the freedom we have known is if we fight for it, protect it, defend it, and then hand it to them with the well-taught lessons of how they in their lifetime must do the same. And if you and I don’t do this, then you and I may well spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was once like in America where men were free.

She was taken aback by the fact that people were very kind and polite to her. In an extraordinary attempt to salvage the victimology narrative, she concluded that this manifest tolerance and kindness was a means by which people overcompensated for their concealed bigotry. If you are unkind to a Muslim woman, you are an Islamophobe. If you are kind to a Muslim woman, you are an Islamophobe. All roads lead to Islamophobia.

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise.

They construct an alternate reality known as Unicornia. In such a world, science, reason, rules of causality, evidentiary thresholds, a near-infinite amount of data, data analytic procedures, inferential statistics, the epistemological rules inherent to the scientific method, rules of logic, historical patterns, daily patterns, and common sense are all rejected. Instead, the delusional ramblings of an OPS sufferer are rooted in illusory correlations, non-existent causal links, and feel-good progressive platitudes.
