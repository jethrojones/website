> Creating is often a solitary experience. Yet work made entirely in isolation is usually doomed to remain lonely. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=628))
    
###### ID 234481692
> Instead, many creators want to be for everyone . . . and as a result end up being for no one. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=655))
    
###### ID 234481693
> One of the best pieces of advice I’ve gotten as a creator was from a successful writer who told me that the key to success in nonfiction was that the work should be either “very entertaining” or “extremely practical.” ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=707))

> The bigger and more painful the problem you solve, the better its cultural hook, and the more important and more lucrative your attempt to address it can be. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=721))
    
###### ID 234481695
> “Only is better than best.” ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=766))
    
###### ID 234481696
> The higher and more exciting standard for every project should force you to ask questions like this: What sacred cows am I slaying? What dominant institution am I displacing? What groups am I disrupting? What people am I pissing off? ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=778))
    
###### ID 234481697
> The first wake-up call for every aspiring perennial seller must be that there is no publisher or angel investor or producer who can magically handle all the stuff you don’t want to handle. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=903))
    
###### ID 234481698
> these complex personal projects must be examined, polished, and then presented to the world in a way that appeals to the audience. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=914))
    
###### ID 234481699
> Adults create perennial sellers—and adults take responsibility for themselves. Children expect opportunities to be handed to them; maturity is understanding you have to go out and make them. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=940))
    
###### ID 234481700
> To go back to the metaphor of a book, anyone can pick a cover for a book or throw together a safe title, but who can know the best choice for either of those decisions? Only you. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=957))
    
###### ID 234481701
> Nobody creates flawless first drafts. And nobody creates better second drafts without the intervention of someone else. Nobody. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1051))
    
###### ID 234481702
> We have to have this kind of discipline. The discipline required to hit pause and return to our prospective studios until the work meets the standards we’ve set for ourselves and that the fans have for us. We need to have our own test: Does a summary of the book work as a talk? Are the early users you’ve given prototypes to already addicted to their early versions of the product? Does what you made scratch your own itch in a way that suggests it will do the same for others? ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1070))
    
###### ID 234481703
> We’re working to get somewhere. But where? That’s not a rhetorical question—there is a real answer, one that is unique to every project. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1082))
    
###### ID 234481704
> Put the website or the beta version of your app or your manuscript aside and grab a piece of paper or open a blank Word document. Then, with fresh eyes, attempt to write out exactly what your project is supposed to be and to do in . . . One sentence. One paragraph. One page. This is a ______ that does ______. This helps people ______. Fill in this template at the three varying lengths. It’s best to do this exercise in the third person, creating a bit of artificial distance from the project so you can’t fall back on, “Well, I think that . . .” Deal with facts instead. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1092))
    
###### ID 234481705
> When your proposition to prospective customers is, “This is like [random genre] mixed with [random genre] with a little bit of [third random genre],” do you know what they hear? They hear confusion. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1105))
    
###### ID 234481706
> If you haven’t thought about who you are trying to reach, then what have you thought about? ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1162))
    
###### ID 234481707
> Each master was a conduit into a new community to whom the book might appeal and be promoted. This was a marketing asset—or rather, a pre-marketing asset—built directly in during the writing and editing phases. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1243))
    
###### ID 234481708
> Positioning is what your project is and who it is for. Packaging is what it looks like and what it’s called. The Pitch is the sell—how the project is described and what it offers to the audience. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1255))
    
###### ID 234481709
> Nothing has sunk more creators and caused more unhappiness than this: our inherently human tendency to pursue a strategy aimed at accomplishing one goal while simultaneously expecting to achieve other goals entirely unrelated. ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1394))
    
###### ID 234481710
> Plenty of people can make great work. Not everyone has the dedication to make it and to make it work. Marketing is an opportunity for you to distinguish yourself, to beat out the other talented folks whose entitlement or laziness holds them back. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1551))
    
###### ID 234481711
> Nobody cares about what I have made. ([Location 1562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1562))
    
###### ID 234481712
> But just because something is constructed, as I once heard a wise person say, that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. In fact, the artificial notion of a launch is almost more important now than ever—customers have so much choice, they tend to choose what appears to have momentum. ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1693))
    
###### ID 234481713
> It is essential to take the time to sit down and make a list of everything you have and are willing to bring to bear on the marketing of a project. Aside from racking your own brain, ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1721))
    
###### ID 234481714
> Hey, as many of you know, I have been working on ______ for a long time. It’s a ______ that does ______ for ______. I could really use your help. If you’re in the media or have an audience or you have any ideas or connections or assets that might be valuable when I launch this thing, I would be eternally grateful. Just tell me who you are, what you’re willing to offer, what it might be good for, and how to be in touch. ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1727))
    
###### ID 234481715
> Amazon has some pretty great pricing and sales data for books. According to their data, the cheaper a book is, the more copies it sells (and, counterintuitively, makes more money than if it were expensive). Economists call this price elasticity. ([Location 1885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1885))
    
###### ID 234481716
> To these people [in publishing], literature is more or less the central fact of existence. Whereas, to vast numbers of reasonably intelligent people it is an unimportant sideline, a relaxation, an escape, sometimes even a source of inspiration. But they could do without it far more easily than they could do without coffee or whiskey. ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1905))
    
###### ID 234481717
> Kathy Sierra, a well-known programmer and game developer, has spoken about needing to consider “your audience’s audience” when designing and marketing a product. She says that creators shouldn’t be thinking “Does this make me look good?” When they are pitching or producing they should be focusing on making their audience look good. Even better, forget the “looking” part—just make them good, period. Or, as Sierra puts it, make them “badasses.” ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=1964))
    
###### ID 234481718
> When you find an influencer who likes your product, hold on for dear life. (Send them more stuff than they know what to do with—chances are they have influencer friends!) ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2005))
    
###### ID 234481719
> Be bold and brash and counterintuitive not only in how you create your work, but also in who you use to market it. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2016))
    
###### ID 234481720
> The last part of the successful utilization of influence is how you use it. ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2022))
    
###### ID 234481721
> Think about it this way: Media outlets have trouble getting people to pay for their own product—what makes you so sure they’re going to be able to convince their readers and viewers to buy yours? ([Location 2056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2056))
    
###### ID 234481722
> If you are going to pursue a press-centric strategy, please listen to my advice on this: Start small. ([Location 2093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2093))
    
###### ID 234481723
> The way I describe this process is “trading up the chain.” In an interconnected media age, outlets pick up and re-report on each other’s stories. By starting with a small podcast where I could tell the story on my own terms, which led to a pickup on a small site that covers a niche, and then sharing and spreading that piece so it was seen by the right people, I was able to ultimately go from a tiny show to one of the biggest and most influential outlets in the world. ([Location 2110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2110))
    
###### ID 234481724
> The last thing you want is to get a large hit and for viewers to feel like there is less to the story the more they dig in. ([Location 2124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2124))
    
###### ID 234481725
> At the most basic level, my only strategy for finding and getting media is straightforward. I google reporters’ names to find their email addresses and phone numbers (yes, they’re publicly available). Then I reach out and explain what I’m doing or what I’ve done. ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2144))

> (I don’t assume it should be interesting to them because it’s interesting to me. I make it interesting, period.) ([Location 2147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2147))
    
###### ID 234481727
> The most newsworthy thing to do is usually the one you’re most afraid of. The thing you joke, “But of course, we can’t do that.” (One of my most famous stunts began with those exact words.) And then you have to actually do it. ([Location 2179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2179))
    
###### ID 234481728
> A broader definition of “newsjacking” would then be: when people and the media are all talking about a certain topic, insert yourself into that conversation by connecting what you do with what they’re already talking about. ([Location 2203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2203))
    
###### ID 234481729
> Advertising can add fuel to a fire, but rarely is it sufficient to start one. ([Location 2262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2262))
    
###### ID 234481730
> The only advertising the publisher did for The Obstacle Is the Way—now approaching four hundred thousand copies sold—was to support the Sports Illustrated article, which showed the book’s popularity in sports. We took this amazing piece of PR and made sure tens of thousands of additional people read it through sponsored posts on Facebook and other platforms. And we did that only after we were able to see that the article was converting readers into buyers. Effectiveness was our metric, not existence. ([Location 2295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2295))
    
###### ID 234481731
> It is true for marketing, just as it is for life. Principles are better than instructions and “hacks.” ([Location 2348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2348))
    
###### ID 234481732
> When it comes to creating a perennial seller, the principle to never lose sight of is simple: Create word of mouth. ([Location 2349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N8SL7FH&location=2349))
