> Most of our educational ingenuity, money, and effort is spent on reading instruction in the first six grades. Beyond that, little formal training is provided to carry students to higher and quite distinct levels of skill.

### 1 The Activity and Art of Reading
###### ID 310377146
> There is some feeling nowadays that reading is not as necessary as it once was. Radio and especially television have taken over many of the functions once served by print, just as photography has taken over functions once served by painting and other graphic arts. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=157))
    
###### ID 310377147
> But it may be seriously questioned whether the advent of modern communications media has much enhanced our understanding of the world in which we live. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=161))
    
###### ID 310377148
> We do not have to know everything about something in order to understand it; too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=163))
    
###### ID 310377149
> There is a sense in which we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=165))
    
###### ID 310377150
> One of the reasons for this situation is that the very media we have mentioned are so designed as to make thinking seem unnecessary (though this is only an appearance). The packaging of intellectual positions and views is one of the most active enterprises of some of the best minds of our day. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=165))
    
###### ID 310377151
> The viewer of television, the listener to radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements—all the way from ingenious rhetoric to carefully selected data and statistics—to make it easy for him to “make up his own mind” with the minimum of difficulty and effort. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=167))
    
###### ID 310377152
> But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and “plays back” the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=169))
    
###### ID 310377153
> Reading and listening are thought of as receiving communication from someone who is actively engaged in giving or sending it. The mistake here is to suppose that receiving communication is like receiving a blow or a legacy or a judgment from the court. On the contrary, the reader or listener is much more like the catcher in a game of baseball. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=183))
    
###### ID 310377154
> Successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to have received finds its way into the reader’s possession. The writer’s skill and the reader’s skill converge upon a common end. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004PYDAPE&location=194))
