> Vision-driven leaders bring energy, innovation, and growth, but they also question the status quo and challenge key assumptions. That can create instability and uncertainty for change-averse colleagues and bosses. This is why change agents aren’t always appreciated. As Jerome and Powell observe, “Their passion is not always welcomed, understood, or long suffered. In return for their persistence for improvement, they are rewarded with labels such as ‘disruptive,’ ‘uncooperative,’ ‘intolerant,’ and ‘insensitive.’”21 ([Location 2122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VNHC41J&location=2122))
