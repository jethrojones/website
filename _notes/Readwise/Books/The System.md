> “Our plan is over there on the wall,” Brandon said, pointing to the right side of his desk. “It’s one sheet of paper.” Indeed, the Michigan Athletics Game Plan had been reduced to a single page, sectioned off into twelve distinct boxes. Running vertically, along the left side, were Long-Range Goals, Strategic Initiatives and SMAC Objectives, short for Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Compatible Objectives, a product of Brandon’s days at P&G. Across the top of the page were four headings: GROW IN EVERY WAY BUILD THE BRAND DRIVE CHANGE AND INNOVATE TALENT AND CULTURE WINS Listed inside the twelve boxes were forty-seven different goals and initiatives, such as “Achieve annual revenues of 160 plus million,” “Own social media,” “Encourage and reward risk-taking” and “Achieve #1 national ranking in licensing revenues and total football attendance in the same year.” ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0AM2XG&location=900))

You have a trend that you’re trying to develop with these habits so that people are doing the right things the right way at the right time so they have the best chance to be successful. “You know you can put all that [winning] out of your mind if you just focus on being a relentless competitor, playing every play like it has a history and life of its own. Be the best player that you can be. That guarantees you the best result if you’ll just do it that way.” ([Location 5153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0AM2XG&location=5153))

> In a world where little things could make a big difference, Saban’s microscopic approach to success stood alone. “He is very detail orientated,” said Smart, who had worked alongside Saban since 2006 and was a regular in the noon hoops games. “I mean, he wants every second of practice organized, every walk-through rep. He wants to plan for it. He wants it on paper, and he wants you to execute it.” ([Location 5189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C0AM2XG&location=5189))
