> Westerners call what they have established out here a civilization, but it would be more accurate to call it a beachhead. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=178))
    - Note: We may recognize what we have created as a civilization, but that doesn’t mean this civil action isn’t hanging by a thread.

> In Nevada you see rainclouds, formed by orographic updrafts over the mountains, almost every day. But rainclouds in the desert seldom mean rain, because the heat reflected off the earth and the ravenous dryness can vaporize a shower in midair, leaving the blackest-looking cumulonimbus trailing a few pathetic ribbons of moisture that disappear before reaching the ground. And if rain does manage to fall to earth, there is nothing to hold it, so it races off in evanescent brown torrents, evaporating, running to nowhere. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=205))

> Powell failed to appreciate the vast amount of water sitting in underground aquifers, a legacy of the Ice Ages and their glacial melt, but even this water, which has turned the western plains and large portions of California and Arizona green, will be mostly gone within a hundred years—a resource squandered as quickly as oil. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=216))
    - Note: How does he know it will be gone in 100 years. How can he predict the future. 
      The reality is that these ideas are based on models that are callable based on the data that they put into it. But they speak of it as though it is a forgone conclusion. 
      This type of modeling should be considered unethical.

> With the exception of a few of the rivers draining the remote North Coast, virtually every drop of water in the state is put to some economic use before being allowed to return to the sea. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=296))
    - Note: The sea is where water is supposed to end up. That’s what we learn in 4th grade science. But what we don’t teach is that water must work before it can return to it’s home in the ocean.
    
###### ID 234478862
> By the end of the century it could rise to a trillion gallons—a mining operation that, in sheer volume, beggars the exhaustion of oil. How long it can go on, no one knows. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=316))
    - Note: Although earlier he said with such surety that it would be gone in 100 years.

> The vanishing groundwater in Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Nebraska is all part of the Ogallala aquifer, which holds two distinctions: one of being the largest discrete aquifer in the world, the other of being the fastest-disappearing aquifer in the world. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=323))
    
###### ID 234478864
> In southern Louisiana, water is the central fact of existence, and a whole culture and set of values have grown up around it. In the West, lack of water is the central fact of existence, and a whole culture and set of values have grown up around it. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=351))
    
###### ID 234478865
> To easterners, “conservation” of water usually means protecting rivers from development; in the West, it means building dams. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=357))
    
###### ID 234478866
> In the West, it is said, water flows uphill toward money. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=365))
    
###### ID 234478867
> (Horace Greeley, the publisher of the New York Herald Tribune—the publisher whose words “Go west, young man” galvanized the nineteenth century—was mainly responsible for this; he had dispatched his agricultural editor, Nathan Meeker, to a spot north of Denver to found a utopian irrigation colony which, not surprisingly, became Greeley, Colorado. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=797))

> Such a spectacular climatic transformation was not about to be dismissed as a fluke, not by a people who thought themselves handpicked by God to occupy a wild continent. A new school of meteorology was founded to explain it. Its unspoken principle was divine intervention, and its motto was “Rain Follows the Plow.” ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=807))
    
###### ID 234478869
> Professor Cyrus Thomas, a noted climatologist, was a leading proponent. “Since the territory [of Colorado] has begun to be settled,” he announced in declamatory tones, “towns and cities built up, farms cultivated, mines opened, and roads made and travelled, there has been a gradual increase in moisture. . . . I therefore give it as my firm conviction that this increase is of a permanent nature, and not periodical, and that it has commenced within eight years past, and that it is in some way connected to the settlement of the country, and that as population increases the moisture will increase.” ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=811))
    - Note: Climatologists have never known what is going on

> The General Land Office bureaucrats sat in Washington pretending that such conditions did not exist. Their job, as they perceived it, was to fill little squares with people. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=937))
    
###### ID 234478871
> Riparian doctrine alone, therefore, made it possible for a tiny handful of landowners to monopolize the few manageable rivers of the West. When their neighbors saw their predicament and sold out, they could monopolize the best land, too. ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=963))
    
###### ID 234478872
> Americans were making a Procrustean effort to turn half a continent into something they were used to. It was a doomed effort. Even worse, it was unscientific. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=988))
    
###### ID 234478873
> Most western valley soil was fertile, and a good crop was a near certainty once irrigation water was applied; in the milder regions the growing season was very long and two crops were possible, so one could often subsist on eighty irrigated acres or less. That, in fact, was about all the irrigated land one family could be expected to work. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1006))

###### ID 234478874
> In the West, where the one thing that really mattered was water, states should logically be formed around watersheds. Each major river, from the glacial drip at its headwaters to the delta at its mouth, should be a state or semistate. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1040))
    
###### ID 234478875
> In Powell’s day, that passion for wealth had if anything grown more intense. A pseudoscientific dogma, Social Darwinism, had been invented to give predatory behavior a good name. Darwin could not be taught in the schools; but a perversion of Darwin could be practiced in real life. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1060))
    
###### ID 234478876
> Since the ranks of the persecuted include those who are too virtuous for their fellow citizens, as well as those who are not virtuous enough, sooner or later the city was bound to attract the victims of mobocracy. And the most persecuted among the virtuous in nineteenth-century America were, besides peaceful Indians and runaway slaves and Mennonites and Quakers, the members of the Mormon faith. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1150))
    
###### ID 234478877
> If growth continued, the population and the water would fall hopelessly out of balance. Everyone was living off tens of thousands of years of accumulated groundwater, like a spendthrift heir squandering his wealth. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1293))
    
###### ID 234478878
> By 1900, Los Angeles’ population had gone over 100,000; it doubled again within four years. During the same period, the city experienced its first severe drought. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1315))
    - Note: If drought was happening over 100 years ago it os not todag cAUSED by global warming
    
###### ID 234478879
> Clover’s Daily News, the only paper on record opposing the aqueduct, lobbed a potential bombshell when it reported that the city’s workers, under cover of darkness, were dumping water out of the reservoirs into the Pacific to make them go dry, thus assuring a “yes” vote. ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1636))
    - Note: There are still accusations today that they are doing the same thing in the name of global warming
    
###### ID 234478880
> Congressman Sylvester Smith. Smith was an energetic and charming politician, a former newspaper publisher from Bakersfield with a sense of public duty and enough money to maintain an ironclad set of principles. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1677))
    
###### ID 234478881
> Roosevelt was a trust-buster, but only because he feared that unfettered capitalism could breed socialism. (For evidence he only had to look as far as Los Angeles, where Harrison Gray Otis was whipping labor radicals into such a blind, vengeful froth that two of them blew up his printing plant in 1910 and killed twenty of their own.) ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1707))
    - Note: Capitalism leading to socialism is a fascinating idea
    
###### ID 234478882
> In the West, drought tends to come in cycles of about twenty years, ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=1830))
    
###### ID 234478884
> Theodore Roosevelt, an easterner, had returned from the West convinced that there were “vast areas of public land which can be made available for . . . settlement,” but only, he added, “by building reservoirs and main-line canals impractical for private enterprise.” But the West wasn’t listening. For the first time in their history, Americans had come up against a problem they could not begin to master with traditional American solutions—private capital, individual initiative, hard work—and yet the region confronting the problem happened to believe most fervently in such solutions. ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=2269))
    
###### ID 234478885
> When they finally saw the light, however, their attitude miraculously changed—though the myth didn’t—and the American West quietly became the first and most durable example of the modern welfare state. ([Location 2276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=2276))
    - Note: The failed individualistic and capitalist approach failed. Author doesn't name Utah specifically but i am curious how much they relied on federal government
    
###### ID 234478886
> Part of the reason the Reclamation Service (which metamorphosed, fittingly, into the Bureau of Reclamation in 1923) seemed so hapless at enforcing its social mandate had to do with the Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1926, one of those well-meaning pieces of legislation that make everything worse. ([Location 2411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001RTKIUA&location=2411))
    
###### ID 234478887
> A more important and insidious reason, however, had to do with the nature of the Bureau itself. “There was a tendency for some engineers to view public works as ends in themselves,” admits Michael Robinson. “Despite official declarations from more sensitive administrators that ‘Reclamation is measured not in engineering units but in homes and agricultural values’ . . . the Service regarded itself as an ‘engineering outfit.’” That may have been the understatement of the year. To build a great dam on a tempestuous river like the Snake was terrifically exhilarating work; enforcing a hodgepodge of social ideals was hardly that.
