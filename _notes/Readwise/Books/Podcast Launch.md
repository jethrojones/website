> Medium cost option: ATR-2100, $59.99. This is my #1 recommendation by a long shot. When you combine cost and quality, nothing compares. If you can afford the $60 price tag…this is a MUST. This microphone also plugs into your USB port, and it is not a headset. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BJUIT1W&location=297))

> I record from Skype directly into Adobe Audition using my PreSonus Firestudio mixer. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BJUIT1W&location=317))

> After your initial release, you can start inserting powerful calls-to-action in the intros and outros. At EntrepreneurOnFire, I change it up all the time. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BJUIT1W&location=348))

> To conclude, remember that as the Host, you have earned the right to use your intro and outro to promote yourself and your business. You are providing great content to your listeners for free, and a respectable call to action at the top and bottom of your episode will be received cordially.

> I also let every interviewee I have on the show know that a rating and review from them would hold a lot of weight. This method will gain you ratings and reviews at a steady pace. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BJUIT1W&location=501))
