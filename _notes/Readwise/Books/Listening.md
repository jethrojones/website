## Highlights

> This may surprise you because the idea of listening as a "skill" is unfamiliar. Communication as a "skill" is a common enough concept. Yet, of all the time we spend communication, by far the greatest is spent in listening ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=99))
    
###### ID 234483496
> Listening involves a more sophisticated mental process than hearing. It demands energy and discipline. Listening is a learned skill. The first step is to realize that effective listening is an active, not a passive, process. This is a difficult concept, but it is true: A skilled listener does not just sit there and allow listening to happen. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=110))
    
###### ID 234483497
> Listening is (a) taking in information from speakers, other people or ourselves, while remaining nonjudgmental and empathetic; (b) acknowledging the talker in a way that invites the communication to continue; and (c) providing limited, but encouraging, input to the talker's response, carrying the person's idea one step forward. This definition stresses the listener's responsibility in the communication process. Although listening is one of the most demanding aspects of communication, it is also one of the most rewarding. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=114))
    
###### ID 234483498
> Listening as a way to acknowledge someone often increases self-esteem. It is a way of saying to the talker, "You are important, and I am not judging you." That is why listening is such a powerful force in human relationships. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=132))

###### ID 234483499
> Listening is a potent force for reducing stress and tension. True listening builds teamwork, trust, and a sense of belonging to a group. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=135))
    
###### ID 234483500
> Listening also encourages people to feel self-confident. For example, when co-workers share their problems, do you get the sinking feeling it is your responsibility to solve them? If so, you are probably wasting your energy. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=139))
    
###### ID 234483501
> A request for listening is usually not a request for giving advice. It is a request to be listened to nonjudgmentally, from the heart. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=141))
    
###### ID 234483502
> Allowing that person to vent negative feelings toward you alleviates the feeling. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=199))

###### ID 234483503
> Defensive listening is a major barrier to efficient communication and problem solving because it perpetuates nonlistening and an argumentative atmosphere. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=208))
    
###### ID 234483504
> Listening to others gives us the information needed to make the most of our communication. Listening to ourselves gives us the information to act in our own best interests. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=211))
    
###### ID 234483505
> Information is power. Effective listeners are able to concentrate and find the most valid information in whatever they hear. Effective listeners are powerful people. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=213))
    
###### ID 234483506
> Level 1: Empathetic listening. At this level, listeners refrain from judging the talker and place themselves in the other's position, attempting to see things from his or her point of view. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=225))
    
###### ID 234483507
> Level 2: Hearing words, but not really listening. At this level, people stay at the surface of the communication and do not understand the deeper meanings of what is being said. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=229))
    
###### ID 234483508
> Level 3: Listening in spurts. Tuning in and tuning out, being somewhat aware of others, but mainly paying attention to oneself. One follows the discussion only enough to get a chance to talk. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=233))
    
###### ID 234483509
> 3. Level 1 Listening nonjudgmentally with understanding to the intent and feelings, paying attention to the speaker's total communication, processing what is being saidLevel 2 Hearing words but not making an effort to understand the speaker's intent, appearing to listen intently when in fact only slightly concentratingLevel 3 Listening in spurts, more hearing going on than listening; being passive, judgmental4. Advantages to listening effectively:• Improved supervisory skills when dealing with employees who have a problem• Decreased time spent in solving problems• Improved self-esteem and self-confidence because you relate more effectively with others• Increased productivity, more information remembered, and decreased misunderstanding• Fewer mistakes made because you listened to the instructions• Increased respect, trust, and rapport with co-workers ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=283))

> The messages may even plant seeds of resistance to listening in the child's mind. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=309))
    
###### ID 234483511
> A stroke is any form of recognition or attention one person gives to another. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=316))
    
###### ID 234483512
> Strokes are a survival need. Often, negative strokes are sent to children, and the parents don't realize the impact they have on a child's self-concept. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=318))
    
###### ID 234483513
> Listening is one of the finest strokes one person can give another. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=328))
    
###### ID 234483514
> We can also stroke others by how we listen to them nonverbally. Often, a listener turns a talker off by a certain look, a shift in body posture to a closed position, or an impatient tapping of fingers on a desk or table. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=335))
    
###### ID 234483515
> Parents who interrupt their children, look stern while listening, ignore their children's feelings, or turn away when their children are talking send a message that what the children have to say is stupid or unimportant. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=342))
    
###### ID 234483516
> We are rewarded when we do well at reading, speaking, and writing, but listening skill wins little direct praise. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=452))
    
###### ID 234483517
> person who gets an A is said to have "learned" the material, but not to have "listened well." ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=454))
    
###### ID 234483518
> Apparently, the school system has accepted the myth that we were born knowing how to listen. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=457))
    
###### ID 234483519
> Say, for instance, I'm your supervisor, and I strongly believe that when people talk and enjoy their work they aren't getting their work done properly. Because of my belief, I value silence and seriousness on the job. I also have the attitude that people who kid around don't perform as they "should" and are more trouble than they are worth. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=470))
    
###### ID 234483520
> Our beliefs could even lead to contempt for each other, thus interfering with our ability to work things out. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=475))
    
###### ID 234483521
> Consequently, we project the same qualities onto others that we deny in ourselves. Others know about these characteristics and would be happy to tell us about them if we asked. For one reason or another, we are blind to certain sides of ourselves, and our behavior often gets us into trouble in our relationships with others. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=488))
    
###### ID 234483522
> When they do stop to think about what they do when they don't listen, adults manage to identify quite a few habits-mostly variations on "thinking of something else"-that interfere with their listening. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=523))
    
###### ID 234483523
> Which of these habits do you identify with? Most people identify with at least three or four. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=530))
    
###### ID 234483524
> One major barrier to effective listening is that, in this society, we have equated speaking with mastery and power. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=547))
    
###### ID 234483525
> Talking is used to gain power(political speech, selling a client a product, selling an idea, or persuading someone to agree with you), to punish (arguments, verbal attacks), to relax (dinner talk, social, humorous comments), and to conceal or reveal (employees concealing ideas or holding back what they feel). Not talking to someone is punishment, and so is not listening. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=548))
    
###### ID 234483526
> In other words, if our perceptions are positive and nonjudgmental, we will be more receptive to what is going on or being said, which in turn increases our interest. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=561))
    
###### ID 234483527
> These factors-perception, reception, attention-happen unconsciously. Often, people aren't aware of the internal process that distracts them from listening at level 1. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=571))
    
###### ID 234483528
> In Chapter 2, I suggested that advice giving often leads to the rescuer behavior mode. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=587))
    
###### ID 234483529
> Notice that a summary of what Jim said led to agreement on what was happening, in contrast to the preceding example where Jim and Dave disagreed. Also, the summarizing of Jim's feelings and position helped him see more clearly what was going on between him and his boss. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=594))
    
###### ID 234483530
> By being an effective listener, Dave stayed out of the "yes ... but" interchange, and by not giving advice, he didn't become a rescuer. Dave and Jim have not solved Jim's problem, ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=596))
    
###### ID 234483531
> When Dave provided support and assisted Jim in talking through the problem, he laid the groundwork for possible future solutions that might have been impossible because of a closed mind on Jim's part. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=598))
    
###### ID 234483532
> Another element that can cause fatigue is the "time-lag factor"; the average ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=727))
    
###### ID 234483533
> 200 words per minute, but a listener can process information at around 300 to 500 words per minute. It is easy to spend this time lag daydreaming, going on mental tangents, and thinking of personal problems. It takes energy to use this time differencefor more productive use, such as internally summarizing what the person said, visualizing what is being said, or associating what is being said with something already stated. Because level 2 listening takes energy and concentration, it is easy to allow these factors to interfere with it. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001KZGWDS&location=727))
