> Instead, I tell these stories because of what they show. In each case, people turned on a dime and used their unique gifts to make a big difference in the lives of others. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=76))
    
###### ID 234480428
> As you’ll see in the chapters that follow, a lot of how our society is organized today assumes that most folks aren’t capable of much. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=86))
    
###### ID 234480429
> People are often treated as problems to be solved, instead of being empowered to help address America’s biggest challenges. In most cases, the general assumption is that major issues—like the coronavirus—can only be addressed from the top down. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=87))
    
###### ID 234480430
> The concept of paradigm shifts comes from the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn.5 He wrote that major transformations “are inaugurated by a growing sense … that an existing paradigm has ceased to function adequately.” ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=110))

###### ID 234480432
> Second: People aren’t problems to be solved. They are often the source of the solution, and those closest to an issue are usually best suited to address it. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=121))

> “The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.” HARRINGTON EMERSON ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=137))
    
###### ID 234480435
> Bottom up tends to work better for a simple reason. When people are empowered, they find solutions to the problems they are closest to, as they have the proximity and knowledge to do so. For this reason, the most important contributions often come from those who are overlooked or dismissed. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=158))
    
###### ID 234480436
> And if every person followed their own best path to contributing to the lives of others, then we could achieve a future beyond anyone’s fondest hopes. It would be characterized by everyone cooperating to foster harmony and progress. Such a society would be more just and prosperous than any yet seen. As I internalized this, my North Star became clear: do all I can to empower people so they can transform themselves—and the world around them. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=163))
    
###### ID 234480437
> This leads to business projects, public policies, and philanthropic grand plans done to people rather than collaborative efforts that enable individuals to discover and apply themselves. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=174))
    
###### ID 234480438

###### ID 234480440
> I saw that the fewer barriers that stand in the way, the more likely people are to discover and act on those gifts. When they do, they make our society better. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=225))
    
###### ID 234480441
> Koch’s growth was generated by what we call “virtuous cycles of mutual benefit,” or “cycles” for short. Because we focus on helping our employees find their greatest opportunity to contribute, they are continually looking for new ways to help the company and themselves succeed by contributing to society. As they build the capabilities to create value, they open the door to new opportunities, which allows us to build still more capabilities. Progress begets progress, in a never-ending cycle. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=239))
    
###### ID 234480442
> So why would we try to enact more one-size-fits-all programs and policies—whether from philanthropists or policymakers—that treat the least fortunate as statistical problems instead of as individuals with unique abilities that can be unlocked with help? ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=280))
    
###### ID 234480443
> There is a better way: believe in people, trust those closest to the problem, and empower them to transform their lives and those of others to escape poverty forever. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=282))
    
###### ID 234480444
> A better approach is to think outside the typical classroom model (in both K–12 schools and universities) to foster individualized education. Meet each student where she is and help her get to where she wants and needs to be instead of forcing her to be something she’s not. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=287))
    
###### ID 234480445
> Nationalism, socialism, protectionism, intolerance, corporate welfare—ideologies and ideas predicated on controlling people and pitting them against each other are gaining ground. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=303))
    
###### ID 234480446
> You only get two choices in our system, so we chose the red team. By the mid-2010s, it was clear that this foray into politics wasn’t going to be successful in helping to remove the biggest public policy barriers holding people back. The experience taught me what George Washington had warned two hundred years ago in his farewell address: partisanship is not the answer. It was a hard-earned lesson that has led to some big changes in how our philanthropic community engages in politics. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=312))
    
###### ID 234480447
> I’m still passionate about removing barriers in public policy, and that requires participating in politics, but not in the usual partisan way. A superior approach is partnership—cooperating with people to accomplish public policies that help improve people’s lives regardless of which political party our partners belong ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=316))

###### ID 234480449
> Studies show that after age 30, your character and work habits are very hard to change. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=402))
    
###### ID 234480450
> Through all my early experiences, I was striving (sometimes unintentionally) to better understand my gift and how to apply it in a way that enabled me to contribute and succeed. It was a long struggle because I was mainly engaged in things I couldn’t do well and disliked doing. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=464))

> second law of thermodynamics, which holds that entropy virtually always increases in a closed system. Entropy is a measure of disorder or uselessness. In lay terms, this means that progress stalls or declines when something is walled off from the outside world. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=501))
    
###### ID 234480452
> During the summer, outside the classroom, I had some of my most valuable educational experiences. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=513))
    
###### ID 234480453
> The more important lesson I took from Gardner—as well as from his critics—is that people, by and large, are neither smart nor stupid. We are all both, at the same time: smart in some ways, stupid in others. We are smartest when we discover, develop, and apply our unique strengths—whatever they may be—and dumbest when we don’t. There’s an old joke that says you’re unique … just like everyone else. And it’s true: everyone has something special to contribute to the world around them.

###### ID 234480454
> My first step was to get my department head’s opinion on the subject. Fortunately, he had a clear-eyed view on the matter and asked me, “What do you want to do?” I told him I wanted to be an entrepreneur. His response was blunt: “Then get the hell out of here. We’ll just make your life miserable for nothing.” I didn’t need another nudge. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=542))
    
###### ID 234480455
> I approached the job as one giant experiment, starting in product development, which wasn’t a great match. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=547))
    
###### ID 234480456
> Up to that point, selfishness and unselfishness struggle to coexist. After all, if you are hungry or homeless, it’s highly unlikely you’ll give up food or shelter for the sake of someone else. Once such needs are met, however, your natural desire to help yourself becomes entwined with helping others, making it easier to become contribution motivated. Your success is tied to their success, and the more you contribute to the world around you, the more you tend to be rewarded, both internally and externally. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=583))
    
###### ID 234480457
> If everyone were contribution motivated, the result would be a society unrivaled by any in the history of the world. But the reverse is true as well: when people can’t contribute, society is significantly worse off. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=616))
    
###### ID 234480458
> The more I applied myself, the more success I found, and the more I wanted to contribute—a never-ending cycle that motivates me still. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=620))
    
###### ID 234480459
> No topic was off-limits; no author was out of bounds. Even those I radically disagreed with shaped my understanding of how things work. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=648))
    
###### ID 234480460

    - Tags: [[sdl]] 
    
###### ID 234480461
> The first and most important is the profound harm to the individual. When people are denied their rights, they have less opportunity to discover and apply their abilities. Every person deserves the chance to find fulfillment, meaning, and personal success—to self-actualize. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=850))
    
###### ID 234480462
> The second reason is the harm to society. When people are prevented from realizing their potential, we are all poorer for it, and not just materially. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=853))
    
###### ID 234480463
> Managers thought they always knew best, believing that their ideas were naturally superior to those of the rank-and-file. There was a near-total unwillingness to ask for or listen to feedback. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=986))
    
###### ID 234480464

###### ID 234480465
> My goal wasn’t to give all the answers, which I didn’t have. Rather, it was to provide the vision, philosophy, and tools for our employees to find answers themselves, to solve problems using their own unique abilities and knowledge. We needed to ask, not tell; to experiment, not stifle. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=1019))
    
###### ID 234480466

###### ID 234480467

###### ID 234480470
> Once again, this is essential to empowerment: if you know you’ll succeed by helping others, then you’ll focus on doing so. That, after all, is the story of progress. ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=1162))
    
###### ID 234480471
> Without going into too much detail, a virtuous cycle starts when a person discovers, develops, and applies her unique ability to create value in the lives of others. The more she develops and applies it, the more she expands her horizons and discovers new opportunities to succeed. As she uses her abilities to a greater degree, she reaches new levels of achievement in a process that repeats over and over. While individuals create these cycles with the development of their aptitudes, a company does so by applying and expanding its capabilities.

###### ID 234480475
> As she explained to the crowd of parents, teachers, and supporters at the banquet, she saw the value in learning specific skills. To write a business plan and pitch it to others, she needed to do well in English. To keep the books and turn a profit, she needed to learn math. She also learned the importance of treating customers with respect, causing a shift in her entire attitude toward those around her.

###### ID 234480477
> By high school graduation, many (if not most) students have little clue what gifts they have, what motivates them, and how they can succeed. They aren’t contribution motivated. They’re often not motivated at all. ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0898QSMLF&location=2097))

###### ID 234480479
> When they got to put their own plans into action, they felt empowered. They were free to create their own business plan and try to make it work. It made them see learning in a new light—one that was practical and tailored to their own talents and interests.

###### ID 234480483
> Why does education fail for so many students and at essentially every level? The answer is that American education largely fails to meet students where they are and help them realize who they are.

Second—and as a result of the first—it develops and supplies the products and services that others use to improve their lives. Third, it helps create a culture of mutual benefit, in which people learn that success comes from contributing.
