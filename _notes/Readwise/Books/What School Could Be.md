> I saw a mosaic of innovative classrooms and the conditions that let them blossom. In every community, I found sparks of learning that are so, so promising but reach only a sliver of our kids. They’re everywhere and nowhere. While a single spark is an anecdote, an aggregation suggests something more—a vision for the future of school, inspired by innovative teachers across America.

> Today, the purpose of U.S. education is to rank human potential, not develop it. •  “College ready” impedes learning and innovation in our K–12 schools. •  All students would benefit from considerably more hands-on learning. •  We’re trying to close the wrong achievement gap. •  We can make education better and more equitable by challenging students with real-world problems. •  K–12 schools, done right, would produce graduates better prepared for life than most current college grads.

> Doing Better Things: We’ll meet inspiring educators effecting change at scale with innovation change models. They understand that our schools need to “do better things,” not “do obsolete things better,” and are establishing conditions conducive to real progress.
