## Highlights
###### ID 38689535
> The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers’ lives and world views. These facts, in turn, help us improve our business. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=128))
    
###### ID 38689536
> Until we get specific, it always seems like a good idea. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=132))
    
###### ID 38689537
> The point is a bit more subtle than this. Eventually you do need to mention what you’re building and take people’s money for it. However, the big mistake is almost always to mention your idea too soon rather than too late. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=143))
    
###### ID 38689538
> The Mom Test: Talk about their life instead of your idea Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future Talk less and listen more ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=147))
    
###### ID 38689539
> Turns out, it was pretty recent. That’s a great sign. To dig further, I asked, “Can you talk me through how you tried to fix it?” He looked at me blankly, so I nudged him further. “Did you google around for any other ways to solve it?” He seemed a little bit like he’d been caught stealing from the cookie jar and said, “No… I didn’t really think to. It’s something I’m used to dealing with, you know?” In the abstract, it’s something he would “definitely” pay to solve. Once we got specific, he didn't even care enough to search for a solution (which do exist, incidentally). ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=217))
    - Note: All the time in education. We just deal with it!
    
###### ID 38689540
> Rule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=224))
    
###### ID 38689541
> The questions to ask are about your customers’ lives: their problems, cares, constraints, and goals. You humbly and honestly gather as much information about them as you can and then take your own visionary leap to a solution. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=259))
    
###### ID 38689542
> It boils down to this: you aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and in return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the problem, you own the solution. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=262))
    
###### ID 38689543
> Unfortunately, they’re almost certainly lying. Not necessarily intentionally. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=276))
    
###### ID 38689544
> Questions to dig into feature requests: “Why do you want that?” “What would that let you do?” “How are you coping without it?” “Do you think we should push back the launch to add that feature, or is it something we could add later?” “How would that fit into your day?” Questions to dig into emotional signals: “Tell me more about that.” “That seems to really bug you — I bet there’s a story here.” “What makes it so awful?” “Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?” “You seem pretty excited about that — it’s a big deal?” “Why so happy?” “Go on.” ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=464))
    
###### ID 38689545
> Once someone detects that your ego is on the line, they’ll give you fluffy mis-truths and extra compliments. Disregard that data and use The Mom Test to re-focus on the person, their life, and their goals. Folks tend not to lie about specific stuff that’s already happened, regardless of your ego. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=486))
    
###### ID 38689546
> Rule of thumb: If you’ve mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=493))
    
###### ID 38689547
> If you slip into pitch mode, just apologise. You’re excited about your idea. That’s good! Otherwise you wouldn’t have taken this crazy leap in the first place. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=500))
    
###### ID 38689548
> If they say they really want to hear about what you’re working on, promise that you’ll tell them at the end of the meeting or loop them in for an early demo, and that you just want to talk a bit more about their stuff before biasing them with your idea. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=505))
    
###### ID 38689549
> Rule of thumb: Anyone will say your idea is great if you’re annoying enough about it. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=507))
    
###### ID 38689550
> Rule of thumb: The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=516))
    
###### ID 38689551
> In addition to ensuring that you aren’t asking trivialities, you also need to search out the world-rocking scary questions you’ve been unintentionally shrinking from. The best way to find them is with thought experiments. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=521))
    
###### ID 38689552
> Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking at least one question which has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=526))
    
###### ID 38689553
> Rule of thumb: You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you’re asking in every conversation. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=534))
    
###### ID 38689554
> Rule of thumb: There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!” You can’t build a business on a lukewarm response. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=561))
    
###### ID 38689555
> “Does-this-problem-matter” questions: “How seriously do you take your blog?” “Do you make money from it?” “Have you tried making more money from it?” “How much time do you spend on it each week?” “Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?” “Which tools and services do you use for it?” “What are you already doing to improve this?” “What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?” ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=662))
    
###### ID 38689556
> Rule of thumb: Start broad and don't zoom in until you’ve found a strong signal, both with your whole business and with every conversation. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=671))
    
###### ID 38689557
> What all this does mean is that if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed to pure market risk), then you’re not going to be able to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=731))
    
###### ID 38689558
> When you strip all the formality from the process, you end up with no meetings, no “interviews”, and a much easier time all around. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=767))
    
###### ID 38689559
> Rule of thumb: Learning about a customer and their problems works better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=771))
    
###### ID 38689560
> Rule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking to you, it’s probably too formal. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=797))
    
###### ID 38689561
> Rule of thumb: Give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the discussion in a useful direction. ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=830))
    
###### ID 38689562
> Commitment — They are showing they’re serious by giving up something they value such as time, reputation, or money. Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world funnel and getting closer purchasing. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=848))
    
###### ID 38689563
> Rule of thumb: “Customers” who keep being friendly but aren’t ever going to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=853))
    
###### ID 38689564
> there’s no such thing as a meeting which just “went well”. Every meeting either succeeds or fails. You’ve lost the meeting when you leave with a compliment or a stalling tactic. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=855))
    
###### ID 38689565
> Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=868))
    
###### ID 38689566
> A compliment costs them nothing, so it’s worth nothing and carries no data. The major currencies are time, reputation risk, and cash. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=870))
    
###### ID 38689567
> Rule of thumb: It’s not a real lead until you’ve given them a concrete chance to reject you. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=946))
    
###### ID 38689568
> You: “We do X. Want to buy it?” Them: “No thanks.” This sort of rejection isn’t helpful because it doesn’t teach you anything. Hard pitching gives binary feedback: you either nailed it or you didn't. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=952))
    
###### ID 38689569
> Rule of thumb: In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is a side-effect. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=975))
    
###### ID 38689570
> Rule of thumb: If it’s not a formal meeting, you don’t need to make excuses about why you’re there or even mention that you’re starting a business. Just ask about their life. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=999))
    
###### ID 38689571
> Rule of thumb: If it’s a topic you both care about, find an excuse to talk about it. Your idea never needs to enter the equation and you’ll both enjoy the chat. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1013))
    
###### ID 38689572
> Organise meetups For marginally more effort than attending an event, you can organise your own and benefit from being the centre of attention. Want to figure out the problems HR professionals have? Organise an event called “HR professionals happy hour”. People will assume you’re credible just because you happen to be the person who sent the invite emails or introduced the speaker. You’ll have an easy time chatting to them about their problems. Nobody ever follows this recommendation, but it’s the first thing I would do if I moved a new industry or geography. It’s the fastest and most unfair trick I’ve seen for rapid customer learning. As a bonus, it also bootstraps your industry credibility.

> Rule of thumb: Kevin Bacon’s 7 degrees of separation applies to customer conversations. You can find anyone you need if you ask for it a couple times. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1067))
    
###### ID 38689574
> Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask The mnemonic is “Very Few Wizards Properly Ask [for help].” ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1106))
