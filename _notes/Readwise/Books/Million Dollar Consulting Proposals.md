## Highlights
### Chapter 1 Business Vows
###### ID 310376918
> A proposal is a summation, not an explanation. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=169))
    
###### ID 310376919
> Here is what an outstanding proposal can do: Summarize and convey formally the conceptual agreements reached in discussions to that point between you and the economic buyer. Detail the objectives of the project. Provide for the metrics of success. Describe the value that will occur once the objectives are met (both personally and professionally). Supply options from which the buyer can choose to determine the amount of value sought in return on the investment (ROI) committed. Stipulate fees, expense reimbursement, and payment terms. Enable immediate acceptance in writing. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=176))
    
###### ID 310376920
> Economic buyer: That individual who can produce a check in return for the value expressed in your proposal without any other approvals from anyone else. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=216))
    
###### ID 310376921
> Conceptual agreement: Concurrence with that buyer about the objectives for the project, the metrics that will measure progress and/or success, and the value to the organization and the buyer that will accrue as a result of meeting those objectives. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=219))
    
###### ID 310376922
> Gatekeeper: Any person who cannot say yes but can say no and sees it as his or her responsibility to keep you distant from the buyer. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=221))
    
###### ID 310376923
> Proposals are not the point of the arrow, they are the heft behind the arrow. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=230))
    
###### ID 310376924
> When a proposal is accepted, you should be able to begin work immediately. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=234))
    
###### ID 310376925
> Trusting relationship: The buyer and you are comfortable volunteering, questioning, “pushing back,” and sharing issues. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=256))
    
###### ID 310376926
> Conceptual agreement: Concurrence between the buyer and the consultant about: Objectives: Outcome-based business results, not deliverables or tasks. Metrics: Measures of progress, success, and/or finality. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=258))
    
###### ID 310376927
> Value: The impact on the buyer and organization in meeting the objectives. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=264))
    
###### ID 310376928
> When someone presents you with an input, turn it into an output by asking, “Why is that important?” ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=274))
    
###### ID 310376929
> That proposal enables a partnership to be consummated, a project delivered, and results generated that reinforce the relationship, creating the potential for additional business in the present and referral business for the future.3 ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=316))
    
###### ID 310376930
> You’re better off with no proposal than with a good proposal in the wrong hands. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=340))
    
###### ID 310376931
> “This proposal is intended solely for Adam Avery, senior vice president of Acme Rockets, and is for the exclusive purpose of creating a partnership between Acme and Summit for the project described herein. It may not be distributed or shared with others without our express approval.” ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=354))
    
###### ID 310376932
> Ironically, the longer one takes to gain a trusting relationship, the more quickly proposals for major projects are accepted. That sounds counterintuitive, but it’s true. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=367))
    
###### ID 310376933
> Professional services providers think that money is a resource. It is not. It’s a priority. So the question is really not one of finding money but of moving money that already exists from something else to you. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=379))
    
###### ID 310376934
> Therefore, time is also not a resource, but a priority. Are you important enough in terms of your value to demand a portion of existing time? ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=386))
    
###### ID 310376935
> Your value distance, Figure 1.2, is your ability to listen to what the prospect wants and find the true, far more valuable, needs. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=393))
    
###### ID 310376936
> If I don’t trust you—that is, I haven’t been convinced of your credibility, integrity, and quality—then all the other excuses take on artificial heft. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=398))
    
###### ID 310376937
> The proposal philosophy, examples, and techniques you’ll find in subsequent pages are all based on the premise that you and I work for a fee based on value, not time, materials, numbers of participants, or other commodity determinations. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=411))
    
###### ID 310376938
> Billing by the hour or day is intrinsically unethical. That’s right, I said it: unethical. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=433))
    
###### ID 310376939
> Your value is in your advice, not your presence. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=438))
    
###### ID 310376940
> Value-based fees are the remuneration you receive as your contribution to the value derived by the client as a result of meeting agreed-upon business results (objectives). They provide a dramatic return on investment for the client and equitable compensation for the consultant. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=450))
    
###### ID 310376941
> Value is in the eye of the beholder, which is why it is reached collaboratively with the buyer in conceptual agreement. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=460))
    
###### ID 310376942
> But behind that might well be my personal need to escape spending so much of my time “refereeing” among warring teams and committees. These personal objectives should be discussed because of the increased value they generate. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=465))
    
###### ID 310376943
> Money is a priority issue and not a resource issue, so the more ROI you present the more likely money will be moved your way. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=468))
    
### Chapter 2 Five Steps Toward Great Leaps How to Prepare Yourself and the Client
###### ID 310376945
> You want to avoid those people who can say no but can’t say yes—the gatekeepers. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=490))
    
###### ID 310376946
> True, economic buyers have the power to spend money on their own authority. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=494))
    
###### ID 310376947
> 1. Whose budget will support this initiative? 2. Who can immediately approve this project? 3. To whom will people look for support, approval, and credibility? 4. Who controls the resources required to make this happen? 5. Who has initiated this request? 6. Who will claim responsibility for the results? 7. Who will be seen as the main sponsor and/or champion? 8. Do you have to seek anyone else’s approval? 9. Who will accept or reject proposals? 10. If you and I were to shake hands, could I begin tomorrow? 11. What is the decision-making process for this type of approval? ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=504))
    - Note: Questions to ask to get to buyers
    
###### ID 310376948
> Ironically, many HR people “tasked” with finding consultants (whom they inevitably regard as vendors) are offended that they, themselves, haven’t been asked to complete the project seeking external resources. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=532))
    
###### ID 310376949
> Sometimes trusting relationships are built in 20 minutes, and sometimes it requires three meetings. (If it takes months, it was not meant to be.) ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=576))
    
###### ID 310376950
> One of the greatest mistakes consultants make is to hurry through what they believe to be the “preliminaries” in order to get to the “deal” and the proposal. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=577))
    
###### ID 310376951
> Trusting relationships are those wherein either party trusts the other with their “wallet”—ideas, information, insights, innovation. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=597))
    
###### ID 310376952
> Well-known intellectual property (IP) and/or visibility. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=600))
    - Note: Positioning
    
###### ID 310376953
> 1. Offer value from the outset. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=607))
    
###### ID 310376954
> 2. Listen and ask provocative questions. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=615))
    
###### ID 310376955
> 3. Look and act like a success. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=621))
    
###### ID 310376956
> 4. Never dumb down your language. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=628))
    
###### ID 310376957
> 5. Stay in the moment and don’t think about “selling.” ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=634))
    
###### ID 310376958
> we’re not talking about results that have an impact on the business and not simply tasks. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=663))
    
###### ID 310376959
> These 11 questions best elicit true business objectives: 1. What is the ideal outcome you’d like to experience? 2. What results are you trying to accomplish? 3. What better product/service/customer/employee condition are you seeking? 4. Why are you seeking to do this (work/project/engagement)? 5. How would the operation be different as a result of this work? 6. Why are you considering this project (to improve what)? 7. How would image/repute/credibility be improved? 8. What harm (e.g., stress, dysfunction, turf wars) would be alleviated? 9. How much would you gain on the competition as a result? 10. How would your value proposition be improved? 11. How would you most easily justify this investment? ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=670))
    
###### ID 310376960
> Objectives are business outcomes and results that have substantial impact on the products, services, and relationships of the enterprise, and which can be measured. They may be new opportunities reached or problems solved. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=705))
    
###### ID 310376961
> Metrics are indicators of progress or success, which anyone can use to determine that key goals have been reached. They reside in observed behavior and/or evidence in the environment. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=729))
    
###### ID 310376962
> Some of the questions you can ask include: How will you know we’ve accomplished your intent? How, specifically, will the operation be different when we’re done? How will you measure this? What indicators will you use to assess our progress? Who or what will report on our results (against the objectives)? Do you already have measures in place that you intend to apply? What is the rate of return (on sales, investment, etc.) that you seek? How will we know how the public, employees, and/or customers perceive it? Each time we talk, what standard will tell us we’re progressing? How would you know it if you tripped over it? ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=731))
    
###### ID 310376963
> Here’s another way to view the evidence you need: Beliefs—Enlightened self-interest Attitudes—Normative pressure Behaviors—Coercion ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=763))
    
###### ID 310376964
> Only through addressing enlightened self-interest can we prompt belief and attitude changes that will be reflected in behavior changes, which produce new results. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=771))
    
###### ID 310376965
> Try not to choose metrics (or objectives) that specify a level of performance, for example, a 3 percent margin improvement or six new customers per month. Instead, create movement in the right direction: Maximize the margins as measured by the profit per customer improving, and maximize new customers per sales-person as measured by additional signed contracts monthly. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=774))
    
###### ID 310376966
> The more we cajole the buyer into agreeing as to what they are and the impact on the buyer personally and the organizations professionally, the higher fees we can justify in terms of return on investment ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=789))
    
###### ID 310376967
> By prompting and provoking the buyer, you can derive a great deal of value from each objective. And it’s the value that will be used to justify the fees you charge, not the objectives. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=801))
    
###### ID 310376968
> Questions to ask to generate value statements include: What will these results mean for your organization? How would you assess the actual return (ROI, ROA, ROS, ROE, etc.)?4 What would be the extent of the improvement (or correction)? How will these results impact the bottom line? What are the annualized savings (first year might be deceptive)? What is the intangible impact (on repute, safety, comfort, etc.)? How would you, personally, be better off or better supported? What is the scope of the impact (on customers, employees, vendors)? How important is this compared to your overall responsibilities? What if this fails? ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=803))
    
###### ID 310376969
> Value is the degree of positive impact personally, professionally, and peripherally that objectives that are met generate. It is the soul of the project, the reason that major investments can be readily justified. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=825))
    
###### ID 310376970
> Never provide a proposal for a gatekeeper or intermediary, even if that person promises to “sell” it for you. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=840))
    
###### ID 310376971
> Forge a trusting relationship first, so that the buyer is comfortable sharing facts, opinions, needs, and desires. Invest as much time as needed to develop that bond. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=842))
    
###### ID 310376972
> Clearly understand and differentiate among objectives, metrics, and value. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=844))
    
###### ID 310376973
> Reaffirm each item in these three areas with the buyer. Ensure that you have true conceptual agreement prior to creating any proposal. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=845))
    
###### ID 310376974
> Never discuss fees at this point. The key is what the buyer’s improved conditions will be. The fees and subsequent ROI will come later. If you are talking about fees or price at this point, you’ve lost control of the discussion. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=847))
    
### Chapter 3 Avoiding Gatekeepers, Intermediaries, and Goblins Accepting Rejection and Rejecting Acceptance

###### ID 310376977
> Work with gatekeepers to the extent that they can help you with the express lane to the buyer. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=873))

###### ID 310376979
> Remember that some buyers might not want to disclose everything in front of a subordinate, and your goal is to establish a trusting relationship with the buyer, so ultimately you’ll want to meet one-on-one. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=935))
    
###### ID 310376980
> You should always point out: “We have three options before us. The two of us can go to Ms. Jones as a team, which is fine with me. However, if there is the chance of any backlash, I’m happy to go alone and take the hit, after your introduction. The third option is your going alone, and that’s not on the table because it’s unfair of me to expect you to do my marketing for me.” ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=966))
    
###### ID 310376981
> they are used when the gatekeeper refuses original appeals to self-interest, which are positive (look good, take credit). These art forms are really based on fear (you’ll be asked questions you can’t answer, what if the buyer is unhappy with the project) and propriety (there is an ethical necessity). ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=976))
    
###### ID 310376982
> The point is that only a true, economic buyer can provide the relationship, conceptual agreement, and approval to create the partnership you need. ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=984))
    
###### ID 310376983
> You’ll wind up on the rocks. Here are the key points to bring to bear when a gatekeeper is not amenable to self-interest to introduce you to the buyer: Ethics: It’s a professional responsibility, and one of mutual respect. Precedent: What’s probably been the case in the past is no longer appropriate. Fear: What if something goes wrong after you take responsibility for vetting and accepting the proposal? Ignorance: All buyers have both personal and professional objectives they likely have not shared with subordinates. Partnership: You are evaluating the organization as a client, so there is a reciprocity here. (Most consultants walk in as supplicants rather than potential partners.) Speed: If you want to get this done then I must talk to the person who can approve it instantly. Clout: Inevitably, the buyer will have to champion this at the outset and perhaps through the implementation. That has to begin now. Credibility: This project cannot be seen as a human resources or training program or it will not receive proper support from line management. (If they don’t believe that, firmly pull their heads out of the sand.) ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=990))
    
###### ID 310376984
> The language you can use with the gatekeeper can be something like these statements (not questions): ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1023))
    
###### ID 310376985
> At this point, you find the buyer by: Asking others you may have met for an introduction. Sending a note (see below). Arranging to meet at an event where you know that he or she will be present. ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1043))
    
###### ID 310376986
> Don’t copy the gatekeeper, by the way. You’re flying at a higher altitude now. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1068))
    
###### ID 310376987
> The reason is that, instead of attempting to develop a relationship with the buyer, the consultant is too scared, too subordinated, too insecure, and doesn’t establish a peer connection. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1072))
    - Note: I think this is my issue
    
###### ID 310376988
> 1. Focus on building the relationship. Don’t launch into a “pitch.” Never bring visual aids. Adjust to the buyer’s style. 2. Don’t feel as if this is a final exam. If the buyer says, “Well, what can you do for us?,” say, “I don’t know, why don’t we discuss your current challenges and priorities?” 3. Discuss “what” but not “how.” The former will stimulate interaction about key concerns but stop short of offering solutions, free consulting, or opportunity for the buyer to say, “That won’t work here.” 4. Provide value immediately. For example, tell the buyer, “In my experience there are three keys to retention of top talent. Are you using all three to your maximum ability here?” Or provide a diagnostic and ask which of three circles or four quadrants (or whatever) the buyer’s organization occupies, and whether it needs to maintain that position or change. 5. Stress that these are strategic issues not suited for subordinates, whose orientation is tactical. 6. Point out that whenever you suggest major change, people will resist it, unsure of their role, so their feedback is often more self-serving than organizationally oriented. 7. Indicate that HR people are often resentful because they are upset that they didn’t think of your intervention first, or hadn’t done it successfully themselves, or weren’t chosen this time. In the worst case, here is the language to use: I’m happy to interview whomever you like. I’ve found that what I hear is often different or antithetical to what you and I discuss, so let’s agree on a date for us to get back together once I see your people. How is next Thursday at 10? ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1086))
    
###### ID 310376989
> Low self-esteem: You feel that you don’t deserve to be there, that you’re not the equal of the buyer, that you’re an impostor. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1116))
    
###### ID 310376990
> Poor business acumen: If you can’t talk about ROI, margins, EBITDA, and valuation, then you can’t speak “executive.” You must acquaint yourself and become conversant in the language of the executive suite. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1126))
    
###### ID 310376991

### Chapter 4 The Architecture of Successful Proposals The Million Dollar Consulting® Proposal Structure
###### ID 310377001
> 1. Situation Appraisal What: The situation appraisal is a one- or two-paragraph description of why you and the buyer are discussing the project. Why: The intent is to begin on familiar ground with the premise of the project clear and for the buyer to being nodding “Yes, that’s correct.” How: State what the improvement desired is and why it’s important to the buyer and/or the organization. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1200))
    
###### ID 310377002
> 2. Objectives ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1225))
    
###### ID 310377003
> What: An objective is a business outcome or result that is to be achieved. Why: These are the “improved client conditions” that generate value and, ultimately, ROI. How: State the objectives gained during the conceptual agreement phase, trying not to use specific numbers (e.g., “five new hires,” but rather direction, e.g. “maximum new hires”). ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1228))
    
###### ID 310377004
> 3. Metrics What: These are the measures of success indicating progress and/or completion. Why: You and the buyer will use these to guide decisions during the project and to validate your involvement in making the difference. How: These are taken from conceptual agreement and stated with bullet points, making sure that there is manifest evidence (indicators) for the objectives. ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1247))
    
###### ID 310377005
> 4. Value What: This is the impact on the organization and the buyer for meeting the objectives, as measured by the metrics. Why: These statements justify the fee by enumerating the ROI and impact. How: Again in bullet point form, noting that there can be several value statements for any single objective. ([Location 1266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1266))
    
###### ID 310377006
> 5. Methodology and Options Always try to provide options for clients. This changes the psychology from “Should I do this?” to “How should I do this?”, which increases your chances for success at least fourfold. Don’t go too deeply into methodology (e.g., “focus groups,” not “six focus groups in four locations”). What: These are the alternatives that the buyer may select from to reach the objectives, the various roads to the destination. However, some routes provide more value than others, even though the least of them will fulfill the objectives.1 Why: To escalate the buyer’s decision to add more value and consequently higher fees because of higher ROI. You are adding to the value “above the line” in Figure 3.1, allowing you to increase the fee “below the line,” which still increases resultant value. How: Meet the objectives with the first option, then provide even more value and differentiation in ensuing options.2 ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1288))
    
###### ID 310377007
> Options are not “add-ons,” nor are they based on more volume (e.g., interview at 40 schools instead of 24). They are qualitatively better, not merely quantitatively larger. ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1319))
    
###### ID 310377008
> 6. Timing What: This is an estimate and preferably a range of the duration of each of the options barring unforeseen circumstances. Why: The client deserves to know the extent of your presences and possible disruptions, and you deserve to have a disengagement date set to avoid any possibility of “scope creep” (the buyer requesting that you stick around beyond the objectives being accomplished at no extra fee). How: State in duration of days, not calendar dates, the estimated time required. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1325))
    
###### ID 310377009
> 7. Joint Accountabilities This is one of the most overlooked elements in a proposal. If you concur that you’re entering into a partnership with your buyer, then it’s only logical that you should each have (and share) accountabilities for success. ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1343))
    
###### ID 310377010
> What: These are the responsibilities that you are each in the best position to support individually or that you can best do jointly, and constitute the key areas underlying the success of the project. Why: By specifying these in the proposal, the buyer is also signing off on his or her personal responsibility and committing to acting in a certain manner, while also being clear on your commitment to critical areas. How: List those that are unique to the buyer, those that are unique to you, and those that you’ll share. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1347))
    
###### ID 310377011
> 8. Terms and Conditions This is my favorite part of the proposal! This is the first time—the first time—that the buyer will see the fees. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1378))
    
###### ID 310377012
> What: These are the fees, reimbursements, and terms of payment for the project described herein. Why: The buyer has now understood the value of the options and can make a reasoned judgment about ROI (return on investment—see Figure 3.1). With value-based fees, there is never a time-based element or meter running, simply a project fee with substantial return. How: Simply state the fees, reimbursements, and terms, without too much narrative and without confusion. Take into account in your fees the elements in Figure 3.1 from conceptual agreement and the value stated herein. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1383))
    
###### ID 310377013

###### ID 310377014
> What: The formal and contractual decision is indicated to go forward with the desired option. Why: Proposals are summations, not explorations. It’s important to allow the buyer the opportunity to make an immediate commitment. How: Include the brief wording and signatory provisions at the conclusion. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1435))
    
###### ID 310377015

E-mail the client that it’s en route, and include the client’s e-mail address in the FedEx options for notification for “sent,” “exceptions,”1 and “received.” This way, if the buyer should tell you later that it wasn’t received, you can specify exactly who signed for it and when.

Set time and date for buyer to expect proposal Prior to end of meeting 4. Set time and date for follow-up after proposal is received Prior to end of meeting 5. Set contingency time and date in case follow-up is missed Prior to end of meeting ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1829))
    
###### ID 310377032

They are important throughout the marketing and delivery relationships, but absolutely critical in the proposal stage. ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1849))
    
###### ID 310377033
> For these and allied reasons, I’ve been suggesting the following preventive and contingent actions: Take your time to gain trust and test that trust, for example, is the buyer sharing with you and seeking advice? Reconfirm everything on the spot, while you’re there. Set definitive next times and dates. Set contingency times and dates. Request a cell phone number and/or personal e-mail. Ask while together, “Are there any obstacles you can conceive which might delay your acceptance of my proposal that we haven’t yet discussed?”4 Move quickly—as quickly as you can. This is enhanced by our very brief and pithy proposal format. Ask the buyer’s secretary or assistant if anything is preventing a return call if the original and contingency aren’t made. Don’t assume the buyer is damaged or dishonest or uninterested. These judgments will adversely affect your behavior. Make three calls, and then write a hard copy letter. We’ll talk about this contingency more a bit later. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1860))

###### ID 310377037
> If you’re using FedEx you can track that and actually see who signed for it and when (anticipating the possible reaction, “Did we get it?”). Always do this by phone, never e-mail.

###### ID 310377039
> Ideally, the buyer shouldn’t even mention you. But coach the buyer: For example, tell the buyer asked about the cost to simply say the proposal hasn’t been reviewed yet although it should clearly be well within budget. This will help you avoid an inadvertent creation of some other interested but unhelpful parties. ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=1993))
    
###### ID 310377040
> Follow up your proposal quickly. If you sense any hesitancy, confront it at the time, not later. In other words, if the buyer says, “I looked it over and things seem just as we agreed, but I’d like to. . .” then ask immediately why he or she feels it necessary to talk to others, to take a few more days, to compare it to the strategic plan, and so forth—whatever it is that finishes that sentence above.

### Chapter 9 Retainers Are to Projects as Montrachet Is to Thunderbird
###### ID 310377091
> Retainer: A fee paid for a given time period allowing members of a client organization to access you as an advisor in a reactive mode. ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=2881))
    
###### ID 310377092

([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=2894))
    
###### ID 310377093

###### ID 310377094
> 2. How? (Scope of the retainer.) The second variable is the nature of the interaction. For example, will it be strictly by phone and e-mail, or also by Skype, or sometimes in person and, if the latter, at scheduled intervals or ad hoc? ([Location 2915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=2915))
    
###### ID 310377095
> 3. When? (The term of the arrangement.) As mentioned, I believe that a retainer must be in effect for a minimum of 90 days because it’s too tough to see the benefits in a mere few weeks, since you’re dependent on the client contacting you. Nor do you want monthly billing, which is too easy to simply abrogate at every hiccough that the client may suffer.

###### ID 310377097
> Scope creep: A project expanding and requiring more labor, beyond the original parameters set in the conceptual agreement and in the proposal, because the consultant is unable to deny a buyer (or even nonbuyer) who is requesting additional work. Generally based on feelings of inferiority. ([Location 2949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VREGLG&location=2949))
    
###### ID 310377098

###### ID 310377099

###### ID 310377101
> Although we’ve been discussing retainers as an evolution from successful project work, they can arise as the original interaction with a client, particularly if you have strong intellectual property, a commercially published book, a powerful referral from a peer, and so on.

###### ID 310377103

###### ID 310377104
> 3. Keep the client apprised of the ending date. Many clients honestly lose track, don’t renew, and then call you three weeks later for help, putting you in the awkward position of providing it possibly free, or having to ask for money before providing it.

After all, you probably (should have) already asked if there were any obstacles not discussed after conceptual agreement but prior to writing the proposal.

###### ID 310377125
