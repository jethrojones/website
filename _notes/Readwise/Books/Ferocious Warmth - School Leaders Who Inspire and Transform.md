###### ID 247069403
> Leadership expert and author John Maxwell’s ‘treat them not as they are but as they could be’ is a great example of the Doug-style Ferocious Warmth leader. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0974J82YK&location=298))

###### ID 247069405

###### ID 247069406
> Cognitive mediocrity is feeling comfort with the status quo: happy with the strategy and thinking that keeps us stagnant or, at the very least, only just keeping up with what society needs from us, rather than leading the education directions that respond to a changing world. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0974J82YK&location=365))

###### ID 247069409
> Leadership is about a way of being, not doing. It’s nebulous, nuanced and elusive. It is as much to do with feeling and energy as thinking and planning. It’s contextual and responsive, and can never be one size fits all. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0974J82YK&location=389))

> Some leadership approaches suggest your leadership teams should contain people who ‘balance you out’, once you learn your ‘leadership style’ during a leadership program. To me this totally misses the point of leadership development. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0974J82YK&location=579))

> Nassim Taleb defines antifragility as: ‘Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors, and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.’ ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0974J82YK&location=707))

> Kise also uses the visual of the infinity symbol with twelve lenses to explore their characteristics and interdependencies. Jane talks in terms of ‘and’. Breadth and depth, community and individual, predictability and possibility. She uses the metaphor of breathing to explain the interdependency, the necessary exhale and inhale.

> In Conversational Intelligence Judith E. Glaser calls this ‘taking the lead’. ‘Quell the amygdala by talking about the threats and fears that are standing in the way of building trust.
