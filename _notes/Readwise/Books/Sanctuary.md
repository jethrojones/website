> “The world is ruled by a million evil men, did you know?” “That wouldn’t surprise me.” “And ten million stupid ones, and a hundred million cowards. The evil men are the power—the politicians, the rich, the fanatics of religion. The cowards are the bureaucrats and paper pushers who are just doing their jobs. The billions of others that existed here were just cattle herded, but I fear the cattle are gone.” ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013Q3P5DE&location=796))
