> There are 4 types of marketable U.S. Treasuries categorized primarily by their lengths of maturities: Treasury bills (maturing at 4, 13, 26 and 52 weeks), Treasury notes (maturing in 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years), Treasury bonds (which mature in 30 years), and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS, inflation-indexed bonds offered in 5-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities).

> But crunching the numbers, a 60/40 mix of SPY and TLT gives you a good balance of returns vs. risk. Perhaps not coincidentally, that also happens to be the ratio most cited by financial advisors as the optimum mix of stocks and bonds.

###### ID 360200407
> All right, so we’ve got our rotation candidates for the “risk-on” portion of our strategy. They are the ETFs: IWM MDY QQQ SPY We’ll be attempting to identify which of the 4 candidates above is demonstrating the most strength relative to the others. That is, which one is outperforming. And that’s the one we’ll buy, under the assumption that outperformance begets outperformance – at least for a period of time. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=604))
    
###### ID 360200408
> Translation: by trading on a fixed schedule, we filter out much of the noise and are better able to see the relative strength (emerging trends) among the ETF contenders. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=629))
    
###### ID 360200409
> OK, we’ve locked in our trading schedule at once monthly. And for our particular strategy, trading on the last day of the month demonstrates a slight advantage over the first day of the month, so we’ll be looking to buy the one ETF that’s outperforming the others in our rotation universe on the last day of every month. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=637))
    
###### ID 360200410
> Crunching the numbers with our data partner, 3 months of returns appears optimal for our particular strategy. So when we’re evaluating the relative performance of the ETFs in our rotation universe, we’ll be using a 3-month lookback. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=657))

> The Sharpe Ratio is a formula for examining the performance of an investment or strategy by adjusting for its risk. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=710))
    
###### ID 360200412
> when comparing two assets or strategies against a common benchmark, the one with a higher Sharpe Ratio provides a better return for the same risk. ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=714))

> SPY Correlation measures the statistical relationship between an investment or strategy and the selected benchmark, in this case the S&P 500 ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=716))

> Max Drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. It measures the largest single drop from a peak to a trough in a portfolio ‒ before a new peak is achieved. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=720))
    
###### ID 360200415
> Each month, when evaluating which of the 4 "risk-on" ETFs to select for the coming period, consider exactly where that top-performer is on the graph. If it’s above the “0.0%” line, that’s the one you’ll buy, as we’ve discussed. But if it is below the “0.0%” line, if all the ETFs are trending below the “0.0%” line, then you’ll go to cash. It’s that simple. The zero percent line on the chart is the cash trigger. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=760))
    
###### ID 360200416
> High-Yield Corporate Bond is a type of corporate bond that offers a higher rate of interest because of its higher risk of default. When companies with a greater estimated default risk issue bonds, they may be unable to obtain an investment-grade bond credit rating. As a result, they typically issue bonds with higher interest rates in order to entice investors and compensate them for this higher risk. High-yield bond issuers tend to be startup companies or capital-intensive firms with high debt ratios. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=894))

> The “Risk-On” Trade ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1005))
    
###### ID 360200420
> Once a month, on the last trading day of the month, we’ll compare the performance of 4 broad-market stock index ETFs to decide which one to invest in for the upcoming month. The ETFs for our risk-on trade are as follows: IWM, MDY, QQQ, and SPY. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1006))
    
###### ID 360200421
> We’ll chart their relative performance by using an online stock chart that provides for simultaneously comparing multiple stocks or ETFs – either the chart incorporated on the Web pages of your brokerage account, or one that is readily available through both paid and free Web services. For illustration purposes throughout this book, I’ve used charts constructed from the site StockCharts.com (specifically, their “Perf Charts”). ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1008))
    
###### ID 360200422
> Once the ticker symbols of the 4 ETFs are entered into the chart (plus SHY – more on this below), and a 3-month “lookback” period selected, the outperforming ETF will become evident: it’s the one whose trendline appears uppermost on the chart (the right-hand border of the chart). That’s the ETF we will buy to hold for the upcoming month until the process repeats on the last trading day of the next month ‒ ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1012))
    
###### ID 360200423
> With the Following Exception Should none of the trendlines for our risk-on ETFs make it above the trendline for SHY (the short-term bond fund and a common proxy for cash), this portion of our strategy allocation will be invested in SHY. This is our cash trigger, and helps prevent large losses in the risk-on trade. So before settling on the outperforming equity ETF, we make sure it’s trending above SHY. If not, we’ll be holding SHY in 60% of our portfolio.* ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1016))
    
###### ID 360200424
> The “Hedge” Trade ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1024))
    
###### ID 360200425
> Once we’ve finished with our “risk-on” trade, we’ll turn our attention to the “hedge” portion of our strategy. Using the same comparative chart, we’ll remove the equity ETF ticker symbols ‒ and the ticker symbol SHY ‒ and replace them with the ticker symbols for our 2 bond funds, namely JNK and TLT. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1025))
    
###### ID 360200426
> We’ll repeat the same process, and select the outperforming bond ETF for the 3-month lookback period. That’s the ETF we’ll buy to hold for the coming month until the process repeats. As this represents our hedge trade, we’ll allocate 40% to this fund. NOTE: No need for a cash trigger here, as backtesting has shown no advantage. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1028))
    
###### ID 360200427
> In the event relative performance testing determines that we keep the same ETF(s) as the previous month, then the only trade necessary is that which rebalances to maintain a 60/40 mix of risk-on and hedge investments. And if the imbalance is slight? Forget rebalancing, save yourself the trouble of the trade, and just let the ETFs ride. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0759X92Z6&location=1032))
    
###### ID 360200428
> And Then? Once the trades are executed, step away from the computer and try not to let the daily market noise lure you into further trading. Approach it once a month, make the trades dictated by the strategy, then let the strategy do the heavy lifting. The results we’ve shown through backtesting are predicated on once-monthly trading. To trade more frequently or less frequently is to strip the strategy of its value. Trade once a month, then go live your life.
