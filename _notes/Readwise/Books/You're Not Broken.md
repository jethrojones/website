###### ID 440938766
> The focus on needing to fix, improve, or heal our current reality is actually the problem. This focus causes more pain than you can imagine. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=140))
    
###### ID 440938767
> As a creative energy, you will always take the path of least resistance. However, you created all resistance as a useful barrier in an attempt to avoid pain. If you experienced a negative outcome, your Superconscious would create a blockage to stop it from happening in the future. Think of it like putting a dam in the way of a stream. No flow can happen until the dam is opened. By Recoding, you open the dam. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=156))
    
###### ID 440938768
> I have one rule when it comes to deciding what you really want to create: that you would love to see it created. That’s it. If there are other reasons, you are not in a true choice! Create end results that you love; no other reason is needed. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=200))
    
###### ID 440938769
> You can actually choose what you would love to create because you are no longer problem-solving. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=264))
    
###### ID 440938770
> To be in the creative orientation, you must BE it to SEE it. You must become “it” before it comes to be. Being whole now is the goal now. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=270))
    
###### ID 440938771
> The magnetic moment is when you have everything you desire NOW. You have become “it.” You have become the person who is 100 percent in alignment with your desire. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=282))
    
###### ID 440938772
> I choose to live my true nature and purpose. I choose to be the predominant creative force in my life. I choose to live a life I love. I choose to be healthy and vital. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=299))
    
###### ID 440938773
> This field is responsible for our mind’s highest functions—the information source that guides the growth of our bodies. It is our brain, our heart, and our memory. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=353))
    
###### ID 440938774
> You are not just a body. You are not just matter. You are so much more! The you that is the most “you” is invisible, non-physical, and more marvelous than you might imagine. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=356))
    
###### ID 440938775

###### ID 440938776
> The Unconscious (or Subconscious)—Defines itself through feelings, creates programs, and runs the body through automation. Its goal is to keep the system going, and its desire is to continue with what has been working (no matter how painful to the Self-Conscious). ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=421))
    
###### ID 440938777
> The Superconscious—Defines itself as a code of information, has unlimited knowledge, and cannot think or feel. Its goal is to be involved in the creation. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=423))
    
###### ID 440938778
> has been observed that a memory (or traumatic emotion) can originate from at least seven generations in the past. This is so we do not have to “relearn” what can cause pain. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=444))
    
###### ID 440938779
> The Superconscious can access all information in the unified field of all possibilities and decides the instructions to give to the Unconscious field. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=468))
    
###### ID 440938780
> The second role of the Superconscious is insight, which is the ability to connect to an inner vision of the future or past, or to understand the instructions given to another individual. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=469))
    
###### ID 440938781
> At a fundamental level, you are a field of unlimited possibilities or a stream of photons held together by consciousness observing. You should be able to change the observation! ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=506))
    
###### ID 440938782

###### ID 440938783
> Forgetting was the only way, because if you are everything, you cannot experience anything. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=525))
    
###### ID 440938784
> You created an idea of what the “perfect life” would be, what success meant, and a set of rules to avoid what you did not desire. However, these rules and decisions ended up becoming a prison you could not escape. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=531))
    
###### ID 440938785
> Pain registers five times more powerfully in the body, and so anytime we experience pain, it is crucial to find out why. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=543))
    
###### ID 440938786
> Remember, we are never allowed to solve the problem because if we do, we will not know who we are. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=566))
    
###### ID 440938787
> I have found there are six unwanted beliefs at the foundation of the individuation phase. I am not good enough. I am not worthy. I don’t belong. I am not perfect. I am not capable. I am not significant. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=575))
    
###### ID 440938788
> They can never solve the negative belief about themselves, and they can never truly be not good enough, because that is far too painful. So, they live somewhere in the middle: never being fully not good enough or good enough. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=586))
    
###### ID 440938789
> the identity/Unconscious level, we don’t actually desire what we are going for. We actually desire to overcome the negative belief we have about ourselves. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=591))
    
###### ID 440938790
> People don’t actually go for what they want. They go after things they reckon would solve the negative belief that they created about themselves during childhood. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=598))
    
###### ID 440938791
> We are only attached to the limitation, not knowing that we created the limitation as a game, so we may experience this lifetime. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=617))
    
###### ID 440938792
> The truth is, you can have everything you desire right now. You do not need to fix yourself. Creating beautiful, amazing results has nothing to do with you as a person. Success is not personal. The idea that it is personal is a big problem. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=652))
    
###### ID 440938793
> If the Superconscious gives you the material to build the ship, the Unconscious builds, runs, and maintains the ship. The Self-Conscious is the captain, and the structure is the body of water the ship is in. It dictates what is possible. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=673))
    
###### ID 440938794
> The Unconscious takes everything personally and looks for the reason for any pain. The Unconscious believes there must be a reason why we aren’t getting what we desire, or a reason why we get what we desire. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=677))
    
###### ID 440938795
> At the identity/Unconscious level, we don’t actually desire what we are going for. We desire to finally overcome the negative belief we have about ourselves. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=681))
    
###### ID 440938796
> Your life-building process is also a structure. This structure has four parts: A current reality. The desired reality. An identity. An action to take. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=697))
    
###### ID 440938797
> All structures are held together by a magical force called “tension,” which pulls things into reality and creates the path of least resistance. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=706))
    
###### ID 440938798
> Structure is created where you put your original intention. If you put your focus on what you desire first and then take action towards it, you are in the creative-oriented structure. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=748))
    
###### ID 440938799
> If, on the other hand, you are sitting around thinking about what is wrong with you/your reality and then deciding you must go and solve that, your first intention is to solve a problem, not create. This is the problem-oriented structure. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=749))
    
###### ID 440938800
> You must become happy now, even if the condition of the problem is still present. You must master the moment and “be in the end result.” ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=800))
    
###### ID 440938801
> This true common denominator—the structure of “the future will be better” and its unwritten shadow of “the now is not enough”—is everywhere in society! ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=873))
    
###### ID 440938802
> you are a prisoner to the condition you won’t allow to exist—it literally owns you. The actions motivated by the beliefs are not yours; they are the actions of the identity that will not allow the condition. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=917))
    
###### ID 440938803
> Successful people do not focus on fixing themselves; they focus on creating. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=982))
    
###### ID 440938804
> There are three types of structures: oscillating, stuck, and flowing. ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=984))
    
###### ID 440938805
> How you structure your life makes all the difference because the structure creates the tension, and the tension creates the movement. With the correct structure, the tension will seek resolution and pull you towards your goal. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=985))
    
###### ID 440938806
> You must be 100 percent satisfied with life now and desire to create more of what you love. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=996))
    
###### ID 440938807
> This is what I mean when I say you are “IT” …always. Both satisfied and driven to create. Peaceful and powerful. In love with what you have and involved with what you are creating. Focused on the end result and loving the journey to get there. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=997))
    
###### ID 440938808
> When you have EVERYTHING now and still want to create more of what you love, you are a Superconscious creator, and life is so much fun. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1014))
    
###### ID 440938809
> Everything is always created twice—once in the invisible and then once in the visible, so there is no reason you can’t have it now. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1024))
    
###### ID 440938810
> if you do not become “it” in the invisible, you will NEVER see it manifest in this reality. This is the first step, and without it, your identity will reject it.! ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1030))
    
###### ID 440938811
> “You can activate your money DNA from another dimension.” The only people who say this sell a course on how to do that. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1074))
    
###### ID 440938812
> if you want lots of money, all you must do is add value to another human. You make their life better—so much so that they want to pay you for it—and you receive money. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1083))
    
###### ID 440938813
> Instead of trying to trade time for money, I needed a structure that would create money without limitation. Because money measures value, I needed a value creation system that worked without me giving my time. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1097))
    
###### ID 440938814
> If you desire to create a huge flow of money, you must simply understand it: You must find a way to add value (in a way that others will want to pay). You must find a way to deliver that value to them (with little time). You must find a way to distribute value (without time). ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1100))
    
###### ID 440938815
> You must have both. You must be the magnet for what you desire and take the action required to see it manifest in this reality. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1118))
    
###### ID 440938816
> Keep in mind that you are always a magnet. You can’t turn that reality on and off. What you create in your reality is a direct reflection of your identity. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1122))
    
###### ID 440938817
> Your Unconscious mind is the domain of feelings. If you do not feel in alignment with what you are creating, you will self-sabotage. ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1180))
    
###### ID 440938818
> I love to break down the words “present moment” into “pre-sent moment”—a moment previously sent by our past condition to create the current moment. You can create a different pre-sent moment by changing the instructions. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1218))
    
###### ID 440938819
> Start with the first choice: “I choose a life I love.” Allow yourself to fully experience that being true and teach your body exactly how it will be in your new reality. Connect to your heart and feel the moment. (Take a few breaths with your eyes closed.) Choose the end result of living a life you love and feel what it is like to have now. Accept it as truth and build a full sensory experience of “living it.” Ask an open-ended question to expand into possibility: “What are all the possible ways I have this?” Notice what comes to you and feel it. Ask another open-ended question and feel it: “What would I love to create to feel this even more?” Open your eyes. Repeat this process with the other three orientation choices: ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1239))
    
###### ID 440938820

###### ID 440938821
> Your first action is to reorient to the world with the core four choices. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1254))
    
###### ID 440938822
> Next, you can follow the five steps of a Recode session and ultimately connect to the Superconscious to change its instructions and reach your end result. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1255))
    
###### ID 440938823
> The core choices that orient you to becoming a magnet for your future are: I choose to be the predominant creative force in my life. I choose to love my life. I choose health and vitality. I choose to live my true nature and purpose. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1262))
    
###### ID 440938824

###### ID 440938825

###### ID 440938827

Get information through a message/symbol. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1303))
    
###### ID 440938828
> To summarize, here are the steps of the Wisdom Process to receive guidance from your Superconscious: Choose an end result you would like to create. Connect to your heart and allow yourself to be present. Close your eyes and visualize/accept the end result of this creation as true now. Notice the current reality or current creation compared to that end result. Ask for the Superconscious to give you a symbol, metaphor, or guidance on what needs to be done next. Write down what you receive and what it means to you. ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092KVCLXN&location=1395))

What do I believe about myself in relation to creating this end result? What do I believe about the end result? What emotions stop me? How am I defining myself in relation to the end result? What am I assuming? Where am I giving the power? What would I have to risk being true if I went for the end result? What internal conflicts do I have about the end result or the action?
