> THE WISDOM OF LIFE CONSISTS IN THE ELIMINATION OF NON-ESSENTIALS. —Lin Yutang ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=47))

> “Just because I was invited didn’t seem a good enough reason to attend.” ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=71))
    - Note: An invitation isn't a good enough reason to go.

> In this example is the basic value proposition of Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=83))
    - Note: give permission
    
###### ID 38689750
> The way of the Essentialist is the relentless pursuit of less but better. It doesn’t mean occasionally giving a nod to the principle. It means pursuing it in a disciplined way. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=100))

    - Note: the [essential] principles and ordinances of the gospel are faith repentance baptism Holy Ghost

> In many cases we can learn to make one-time decisions that make a thousand future decisions so we don’t exhaust ourselves asking the same questions again and again. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=115))
    - Note: this is the whole point of making covenants

> “Why is it,” I wonder, “that we have so much more ability inside of us than we often choose to utilize?” And “How can we make the choices that allow us to tap into more of the potential inside ourselves, and in people everywhere?” ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=153))
    - Note: I am a child of God. we have the potential to be future Gods. we just need to take advantage of that.
    
###### ID 38689755
> One reason is that in our society we are punished for good behavior (saying no) and rewarded for bad behavior (saying yes). The former is often awkward in the moment, and the latter is often celebrated in the moment. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=173))
    - Note: good is evil and evil is good
    
###### ID 38689756
> As Peter Drucker said, “In a few hundred years, when the history of our time will be written from a long-term perspective, it is likely that the most important event historians will see is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is an unprecedented change in the human condition. For the first time—literally—substantial and rapidly growing numbers of people have choices. For the first time, they will have to manage themselves. And society is totally unprepared for it.” ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=192))
    - Note: choice is what we finally have as a society.

> “What do I feel deeply inspired by?” and “What am I particularly talented at?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?” ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=293))
    - Note: need to be inspired

> “People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’ ” ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=300))
    - Note: so is there a plce where it is ok to say no to a calling?
    
###### ID 38689759
> Remember, when we forfeit our right to choose, someone else will choose for us. So we can either deliberately choose what not to do or allow ourselves to be pulled in directions we don’t want to go. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=306))
    - Note: This pertains to sin as well
    
###### ID 38689760
> What if schools eliminated busywork and replaced it with important projects that made a difference to the whole community? ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=323))
    
###### ID 38689761
> To harness the courage we need to get on the right path, it pays to reflect on how short life really is and what we want to accomplish in the little time we have left. As poet Mary Oliver wrote: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?” ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=339))
    
###### ID 38689762
> This experience brought me to the liberating realization that while we may not always have control over our options, we always have control over how we choose among them. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=400))
    
###### ID 38689763
> To become an Essentialist requires a heightened awareness of our ability to choose. We need to recognize it as an invincible power within us, existing separate and distinct from any other thing, person, or force.

> This is similarly true when companies claim that their mission is to serve all stakeholders—clients, employees, shareholders—equally. To say they value equally everyone they interact with leaves management with no clear guidance on what to do when faced with trade-offs between the people they serve.

> An Essentialist makes trade-offs deliberately. She acts for herself rather than waiting to be acted upon. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=612))

> This logic holds true in our personal lives as well. When we were newlyweds, Anna and I met someone who had, as far as we could tell, an amazing marriage and family. We wanted to learn from him, so we asked him, What’s your secret? One of the things he told us was that he and his wife had decided not to be a part of any clubs. He didn’t join the local lodge. She didn’t join the book clubs. It wasn’t that they had no interest in those things. It was simply that they made the trade-off to spend that time with their children. Over the years their children had become their best friends—well worth the sacrifice of any friendships they might have made on the golf course or over tattered copies of Anna Karenina.

> The gravitational pull of Nonessentialism can be so strong that it can be tempting to skip over or skim over this step. Yet this step, in itself, is essential to the disciplined pursuit of less. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=653)) 
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    
###### ID 38689770
> To discern what is truly essential we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=654))

> Inspired by Newton, I took a similar, if perhaps less extreme, approach to writing this book. I blocked off eight hours a day to write: from 5:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M., five days a week. The basic rule was no e-mail, no calls, no appointments, and no interruptions until after 1:00 P.M. I didn’t always achieve it, but the discipline made a big difference. I set my e-mail bounceback to explain that I was in “monk mode” until after the book was complete. It is difficult to overstate how much freedom I found in this approach. By creating space to explore, think, and write, I not only got my book done faster but gained control over how I spent the rest of my time.

###### ID 38689773
> If setting aside a full week seems overwhelming or impossible, there are ways of putting a little “Think Week” into every day. One practice I’ve found useful is simply to read something from classic literature (not a blog, or the newspaper, or the latest beach novel) for the first twenty minutes of the day. Not only does this squash my previous tendency to check my e-mail as soon as I wake up, it centers my day. It broadens my perspective and reminds me of themes and ideas that are essential enough to have withstood the test of time.

###### ID 38689774
> The way of the Nonessentialist is to see sleep as yet another burden on one’s already overextended, overcommitted, busy-but-not-always-productive life. Essentialists instead see sleep as necessary for operating at high levels of contribution more of the time. This is why they systematically and deliberately build sleep into their schedules so they can do more, achieve more, and explore more. By “protecting their asset” they are able to go about their daily lives with a reserve of energy, creativity, and problem-solving ability to call upon when needed—unlike Nonessentialists, who can never know when and where they’ll be hijacked by their own fatigue.

> You can think of this as the 90 Percent Rule, and it’s one you can apply to just about every decision or dilemma. As you evaluate an option, think about the single most important criterion for that decision, and then simply give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than 90 percent, then automatically change the rating to 0 and simply reject it. This way you avoid getting caught up in indecision, or worse, getting stuck with the 60s or 70s. Think about how you’d feel if you scored a 65 on some test. Why would you deliberately choose to feel that way about an important choice in your life? ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=1166))

###### ID 38689776
> Here’s a simple, systematic process you can use to apply selective criteria to opportunities that come your way. First, write down the opportunity. Second, write down a list of three “minimum criteria” the options would need to “pass” in order to be considered. Third, write down a list of three ideal or “extreme criteria” the options would need to “pass” in order to be considered. By definition, if the opportunity doesn’t pass the first set of criteria, the answer is obviously no. But if it also doesn’t pass two of your three extreme criteria, the answer is still no.

> We do a similar thing in our personal lives as well. When we are unclear about our real purpose in life—in other words, when we don’t have a clear sense of our goals, our aspirations, and our values—we make up our own social games. We waste time and energies on trying to look good in comparison to other people. We overvalue nonessentials like a nicer car or house, or even intangibles like the number of our followers on Twitter or the way we look in our Facebook photos. As a result, we neglect activities that are truly essential, like spending time with our loved ones, or nurturing our spirit, or taking care of our health.

> Instead, Martha and her team came up with this essential intent: “To get everyone in the U.K. online by the end of 2012.” It was simple, concrete, inspiring, and easily measured. It gave everyone on the team clarity about exactly what they were trying to do, so they could coordinate their actions and energies to eliminate everything else. It empowered everyone on the team, however junior, to push back and say, “But does this new idea really help us to achieve our intent?” And it enabled them to better harness the support of partners to massively accelerate the journey. And even though their full aspiration isn’t yet reached, that clarity of purpose enabled them to make a far greater contribution than they could have made under any other circumstances.

> Have you ever felt a tension between what you felt was right and what someone was pressuring you to do? Have you ever felt the conflict between your internal conviction and an external action? Have you ever said yes when you meant no simply to avoid conflict or friction? Have you ever felt too scared or timid to turn down an invitation or request from a boss, colleague, friend, neighbor, or family member for fear of disappointing them? If you have, you’re not alone. Navigating these moments with courage and grace is one of the most important skills to master in becoming an Essentialist—and one of the hardest.

> However, not pushing back costs more: our ability to choose what is most essential in life. For Jin-Yung and Clay, respect in the workplace and time for God and family were most important, so these were the things they deliberately and strategically chose to prioritize. After all, if you don’t set boundaries—there won’t be any. Or even worse, there will be boundaries, but they’ll be set by default—or by another person—instead of by design.

> Another quick test for finding your dealbreakers is to write down any time you feel violated or put upon by someone’s request. It doesn’t have to be in some extreme way for you to notice it. Even a small “pinch” (to use a description I think is helpful for describing a minor violation of your boundaries) that makes you feel even a twinge of resentment—whether it’s an unwanted invitation, an unsolicited “opportunity,” or a request for a small favor—is a clue for discovering your own hidden boundaries.

Ask him, “What obstacles or bottlenecks are holding you back from achieving X, and how can I help remove these?” Instead of pestering him, offer sincerely to support him.

> Olympians make all these feats of amazing athleticism seem so effortless. Of course Olympic athletes arguably practice longer and train harder than any other athletes in the world—but when they get in that pool, or on that track, or onto that rink, they make it look positively easy. It’s more than just a natural extension of their training. It’s a testament to the genius of the right routine. The way of the Nonessentialist is to think the essentials only get done when they are forced. That execution is a matter of raw effort alone. You labor to make it happen. You push through. The way of the Essentialist is different. The Essentialist designs a routine that makes achieving what you have identified as essential the default position. Yes, in some instances an Essentialist still has to work hard, but with the right routine in place each effort yields exponentially greater results.
