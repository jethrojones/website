###### ID 234481251
> The biggest secret in cyberwar—the one our adversaries now know all too well—is that the same nation that maintains the greatest offensive cyber advantage on earth is also among its most vulnerable. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=306))

> The documents were littered with references to NSA backdoors in nearly every piece of commercial hardware and software on the market. The agency appeared to have acquired a vast library of invisible backdoors into almost every major app, social media platform, server, router, firewall, antivirus software, iPhone, Android phone, BlackBerry phone, laptop, desktop, and operating system.

> The Times had held the story for a year after the Bush administration argued that it could jeopardize investigations and tip off suspected terrorists. Like Greenwald, Snowden was also furious with the Times for holding the story. That was the reason, Snowden said, that he had not brought the stolen NSA documents to the Times in the first place.

But despite their repeated promises to fetch the missing memos from Greenwald’s Brazilian compound, it was clear that somebody was in no mood to share his toys.

###### ID 234481259
> In the United States, government hackers and spies hoarded zero-days for the sake of espionage, or in the event they might need to do what the Pentagon calls D5—“deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy”—an adversary’s critical infrastructure in the event of war one day. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=640))

> “Trustworthy Computing is more important than any other part of our work,” Gates wrote in his now infamous memo. “Computing is already an important part of many people’s lives. Within 10 years, it will be an integral and indispensable part of almost everything we do. Microsoft and the computer industry will only succeed in that world if [chief information officers], consumers and everyone else sees that Microsoft has created a platform for Trustworthy Computing.” ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=939))
    
###### ID 234481263
> In the military, secure communications mean the difference between life and death, but the big technology companies didn’t seem to grasp that. “People were clearly designing these systems for functionality, not for security. They weren’t thinking about how they could be manipulated.” ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=1047))

###### ID 234481267
> “I think people tend to fall into the trap of being disdainful too often of their adversaries,” Faurer would later recall. “We tended to think that in technical matters we were ahead of the Soviet Union—for example, in computers, aircraft engines, cars. In recent years, we have encountered surprise after surprise and are more respectful. Most folks would now concede that they have enormously narrowed the gap and have caught us in a number of places.” ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=1597))

> For years, anytime intelligence officials visited Gosler’s office at CIA headquarters in Langley, they were greeted with the following Pritchett quote on the wall: Organizations can’t stop the world from changing. The best they can do is adapt. The smart ones change before they have to. The lucky ones manage to scramble and adjust, when push comes to shove. The rest are losers, and they become history.

> it began encroaching on CIA turf. Langley knew that if it did not quickly redefine its role in this emerging digital landscape, it would be elbowed out for good. Already the CIA leadership was busy pushing back on policymakers advocating that—in the post–Cold War era—the CIA should be abolished, with its primary functions turned over to the State Department.

###### ID 234481270
> Sometimes digital exploitation was as easy as sending a CIA officer into the C-suite of a major technology supplier and asking them, point-blank, to incorporate spiked NSA hardware or microchips into their supply chain—the old do-it-for-your-country approach. ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=1988))

###### ID 234481276
> Increasingly, NSA’s work was riddled with conflicts of interest and moral hazards. Nobody seemed to be asking what all this breaking and entering and digital exploitation might mean for the NSA’s sponsors—American taxpayers—who now relied on NSA-compromised technology not only for communication but for banking, commerce, transportation, and health care. ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=2278))
    
###### ID 234481277

> “We might not have agreed with everything our government was doing, but if you’re going to sell exploits, at least the U.S. government is one of the more ethically responsible ones. Most of us came from the NSA. This was a good way to transition out. We didn’t have to deal with the bureaucracy. We could make good money, and still be aligned with the agency’s mission.” If they ever had any hesitation, well, ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=2811))
    
###### ID 234481284
> Eventually their arguments won out: Wassenaar’s language was narrowed to the systems that “command and control” intrusion software. And even then—even after Wassenaar’s member states adopted the limited language into law—the United States, without explanation, never has. As a result, the United States exploit market remains largely unregulated. The exception are tools that fall under older encryption export controls.

> He and his business partner scoured Amnesty International reports and mapped out governments with proven records of democratic norms, respect for civil liberties, press rights. They vowed to only work with governments in the upper right quadrants. It was a familiar story, one I would hear time and time again from hackers who believed that by coming up with their own ethical code, they could keep the darker forces of the internet—authoritarianism, repression, the police states—at bay a bit longer.

> An NSO ethics committee comprised of employees and external counsel vetted its customers based on human rights rankings set by the World Bank and other global bodies, they claimed.

> And then they hit publish. “We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech,” then Google’s head lawyer, David Drummond, wrote in a blog post. “These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered—combined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web—have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn.” ([Location 3903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0877D6H28&location=3903))
