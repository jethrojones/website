## Highlights
###### ID 344804263
> In Mastering Leadership, authors Robert J. Anderson and William A. Adams state, “The development of leadership effectiveness must, at a minimum, keep pace with the rate of change and the rate of escalating complexity.” Unfortunately, the development of leadership effectiveness is not keeping pace with the rate of change and escalating complexity (Page 13)
    
###### ID 344804264
> There are two primary known, unspoken problems with leadership development: most leaders are not very effective, and leadership development is largely broken. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 344804265
> Development Dimensions International reported that 60 percent of employees acknowledge their boss damages their self-esteem (Page 14)
    
###### ID 344804266
> Positive change consultant Michelle McQuaid, PhD, found that 65 percent of employees said that having a better boss would make them happier than getting a pay raise. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 344804267
> Gallup found that in the United States, a meager 36 percent of employees were found to be engaged in their work, and managers account for 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 344804268
> Gallup also reported that when it comes to performance reviews, a meager 14 percent of employees strongly agree the reviews they received inspired them to improve, just 20 percent of employees strongly agree their performance was managed in a way that motivated them to do outstanding work, and only 26 percent of employees strongly agreed their manager continually helped them clarify priorities (Page 14)
    
###### ID 344804269
> Hogan, a leadership assessment organization, reported that 75 percent of employees say their immediate supervisor is the most stressful part of their job. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 344804270
> 75 percent of organizations rated their leadership development programs as not very effective, and 71 (Page 14)
    
###### ID 344804271
> Why This Book is Needed Now more than Ever| xv percent of organizations did not feel their leaders were able to lead their organization into the future. (Page 15)
    
###### ID 344804272
> The unknown, unspoken problem is that over the last seventy years of leadership development, when leadership developers and researchers have talked or written about development, they have primarily been referring to horizontal development (Page 15)
    
###### ID 344804273
> Horizontal development focuses on improving a leader’s knowledge, skills, and abilities (Page 15)
    
###### ID 344804274
> Vertical development is not about helping a leader do more; it is about helping the leader be better. It is not focused on simply downloading new knowledge, skills, or abilities onto a person; it is about upgrading their internal operating system, such that they operate and navigate life at a higher level. (Page 16)
    
###### ID 344804275
> The technical definition of vertical development is elevating a leader’s ability to make meaning of their world in more cognitively and emotionally sophisticated ways. (Page 17)
    
###### ID 344804276
> The people with more elevated internal operating systems, those who make meaning of their world in more cognitively and emotionally sophisticated ways, function at a higher level, and they have a greater capacity to navigate change, pressure, uncertainty, and complexity. (Page 17)

> the Digital Vertical Development Coach provides you with regular workouts specifically geared to strengthen the positive mindset neural connections identified and promoted in this book. (Page 22)
    
###### ID 344804278
> Vertical Development Law #1 Leaders make meaning of their world at different levels of cognitive and emotional sophistication. (Page 27)
    
###### ID 344804279
> Vertical Development Law #2 Different leaders may experience the exact same conditions, but if they are at different levels of vertical development, they will see the conditions differently, process the conditions differently, and respond differently to those same conditions. (Page 33)
    
###### ID 344804280
> Vertical Development Law #3 As leaders’ altitude of vertical development rises, they become more conscious of the dynamics of their world. They can see further, see more clearly, see more details, and see more interdependently. (Page 47)
    
###### ID 344804281
> Developmental psychologists initially neglected the development of adults because it was largely assumed that cognitive and emotional maturation essentially stopped after people entered adulthood. (Page 48)
    
###### ID 344804282
> 1. Adults can develop and mature cognitively and emotionally. This form of development is what we now refer to as vertical development. 2. Generally, there are three base stages of adult vertical development. 3. While it is possible for adults to develop vertically through differ ent stages, relatively few actually do develop vertically. (Page 49)
    
###### ID 344804283
> Vertical Development Law #4 Leaders at a higher level of vertical development can see why someone at a lower level of vertical development operates the way they do. But leaders at a lower level of vertical development have a hard time seeing why someone at a higher level of vertical development operates the way they do. (Page 55)
    
###### ID 344804284
> Vertical Development Law #5 The greater a leader’s vertical development altitude, the more capable they are at dealing with change, pressure, uncertainty, and complexity. (Page 61)
    
###### ID 344804285
> Vertical Development Law #6 When leaders have risen in their vertical elevation and traverse previous terrain, they will see it differently, interpret it differently, and likely navigate it differently. (Page 75)
    
###### ID 344804286
> Vertical Development Law #7 Leaders are able to operate at any altitude level they have traversed in the past, but they cannot operate at an altitude level that is higher than what they have traversed so far. (Page 87)

> When you have a Mind 3.0 leader, you do not need any other type of leader because they can bring the parts of them that are best needed in every situation (Page 109)
    
###### ID 344804301
> Vertical Development Law #8 Leaders will operate at a lower altitude when their body budget is depleted, when they feel over-extended, stressed, tired, and/ or hungry. Leaders will operate at a higher altitude when their body budget is full. (Page 113)
    
###### ID 344804302
> Vertical Development Law #9 Leaders do not primarily function at the highest altitude they have traversed. Instead, they operate somewhere between base camp and their highest climb. The level that leaders generally operate at is called their center of gravity (Page 121)
    
###### ID 344804303
> Vertical Development Law #10 Leaders’ foundational meaning-makers are their mindsets. These are their mental lenses that filter the information that comes into their brain, interpret that information in unique ways, and activate the elements about themselves to best navigate the situation based upon the information filtered in and how it is interpreted. (Page 135)
    
###### ID 344804304
> The trait assumption suggests that leaders manifest their traits, styles, and characteristics in the same form and fashion across all the situations they encounter. (Page 138)
    
###### ID 344804305
> Vertical Development Law #11 When leaders operate at a higher vertical development altitude, they are okay looking bad in the process of learning and growing, they are okay being wrong in the process of finding truth and thinking optimally, and they are okay wading through problems to reach their purpose-fueled destination. They are also okay putting themselves on the back burner if it means that they can better lift others. These behaviors may not make sense to those who are less vertically developed. (Page 145)
    
###### ID 344804306
> both psychology and neuroscience have identified mindsets as being the most foundational aspect of why we process information and operate the way we do. (Page 151)
    
###### ID 344804307
> Vertical Development Law #12 Elevating leaders’ vertical altitude requires an investigation of how they make meaning of their world and why they make meaning in the ways that they do. This generally involves a rejection, release, or surrender of current worldviews and the acceptance, adoption, and reassertion of new worldviews. It is as much about dismantling as it is about forging. (Page 157)

> The Wiring to Survive May Not Be the Wiring Needed to Thrive (Page 166)
    
###### ID 344804309
> Vertical Development Law #13 The less vertically developed leaders are, the more resistant they are to vertical development. The more vertically developed they are, the more leaders recognize the importance of vertical development. (Page 169)
    
###### ID 344804310
> This interplay between vertical development and trauma is so strong that we cannot address vertical development without addressing trauma (Page 170)
    
###### ID 344804311
> trauma is less about what we experience and more about how our bodies react to what we experience. (Page 171)
    
###### ID 344804312
> Trauma results in a fundamental reorganization of the way mind and brain manage perceptions. It changes not only how we think and what we think about, but also our very capacity to think. (Page 179)
    
###### ID 344804313
> Vertical Development Law #14 Leaders put into place organizational structures, practices, and policies that emerge from their level of vertical altitude. More sophisticated leaders implement more sophisticated and effective structures, practices, and policies. (Page 193)
    
###### ID 344804314
> Vertical Development Law #15 The culture of an organization is a reflection of its leaders’ level of vertical development. (Page 199)
    
###### ID 344804315
> Vertical Development Law #16 Organizations cannot evolve beyond their leaders’ level of vertical development. (Page 217)
    
###### ID 344804316
> Vertical Development Law #17 There is no organizational transformation without a preceding transformation in the vertical development of the organization’s leaders. (Page 227)
    
###### ID 344804317
> Vertical Development Law #18 The most effective way to shift the altitude of an organization is to shift the vertical altitude of its executive team by elevating their cognitive and emotional sophistication. (Page 241)
    
###### ID 344804318
> Vertical Development Law #19 The more vertically developed leaders are, the more capable they are of leading successful change, and the more they recognize that organizational change starts with changing themselves. (Page 251)
