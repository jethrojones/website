## Highlights
###### ID 310376864
> Having a strategy suggests an ability to look up from the short term and the trivial to view the long term and the essential, to address causes rather than symptoms, to see woods rather than trees. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=68))
    
### CHAPTER 1 Origins 1: Evolution
###### ID 310376866
> From the study of these societies and those of chimps we can identify some of the elemental features of strategic behavior.13 These features emerge out of social structures that invite conflict. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=342))
    
###### ID 310376867
> They require some recognition of the distinctive attributes of individuals who are potential opponents or allies, and sufficient empathy with these individuals’ situations to make it possible to influence their behavior, including by impressing or misleading them. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=344))
    
###### ID 310376868
> The most effective strategies do not depend solely on violence—though this can play an instrumental role, by demonstrating superiority as much as expressing aggression—but benefit instead from the ability to forge coalitions. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=346))
    
###### ID 310376869
> The elements of strategic behavior have not changed, only the complexity of the situations in which they must be applied. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=348))
    
### CHAPTER 2 Origins 2: The Bible
###### ID 310376871
> the political role of philosophy, including damning those that had gone before for the very qualities that had made their intellects strategic. It was Plato who labeled this prior philosophy as sophism, for which he developed a formidable charge sheet. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=927))
    
###### ID 310376872
> According to Plato, the sophists were not serious in their philosophical endeavors. They had given up on the search for truth in order to play rhetorical games, using their persuasive powers on behalf of any case—however unworthy the cause or perverse the logic—in return for payment. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=929))
    
###### ID 310376873
> Plato bequeathed an enduring and demeaning image of the sophists as the “spin-doctors” of their day, rhetorical strategists, relativist in their morality, disinterested in truth, suggesting that all that really mattered was power. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=931))
    - Note: Sounds like the news media and politicians of our day
    
###### ID 310376874
> They were hired hands, traveling wordsmiths who sold their skills to the highest bidder without any view of right and wrong. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=932))
    - Note: Ad men
    
###### ID 310376875
> They displayed an appalling capacity to defeat a just argument by an unjust one and so use their cleverness to confuse ordinary people. An art put up for sale lost its worth. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=933))
    
###### ID 310376876
> Tricks with language allowed the foolish and ignorant to appear wise and knowledgeable. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=937))
    
###### ID 310376877
> This charge sheet has now been discredited: the sophists were not a coherent group, and their views were complex and varied. It was not a collective name they chose for themselves, and it only acquired a pejorative connotation because of Plato. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=938))
    
###### ID 310376878
> A number may not even have been that interested in persuasion but were instead experimenting in discourse and also providing a form of intellectually mischievous entertainment. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=940))
    - Note: Sophists
    
###### ID 310376879
> Pericles saw intellectual cultivation as something to which all Athenians aspired; Plato saw philosophy as an exclusive vocation with pure objectives. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=948))
    
###### ID 310376880
> Plato believed that true philosophers would be so special that they should be rulers. This would not be because they were skilled in argument and could get people to support their preferred course of action, for Plato did not believe in democracy. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=949))

###### ID 310376881
> Apparently contradicting his insistence on truth as the highest goal was his advocacy of a foundational myth, a “noble lie” that would keep the people “content in their roles.” ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=955))
    
###### ID 310376882
> The advocate was Socrates: “We want one single, grand lie which will be believed by everybody—including the rulers ideally, but failing that the rest of the city.”36 ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=956))
    
###### ID 310376883
> Not everyone could have this sort of insight and this created responsibilities when dealing with lesser minds, the lower classes whose grasp of the world was always bound to be limited and illusory. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=960))
    
###### ID 310376884
> The noble lie was therefore one for good purpose, introduced by Socrates as charter myths for his ideal city. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=961))
    
###### ID 310376885
> The noble lie was a white lie on a grand scale. Just as children might be tricked into taking medicines or soldiers encouraged into battle, so communities had to be educated into a belief in social harmony and a conviction that the existing order was natural. ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=963))
    - Note: Unfortunately in order for the noble lie to have any value, the truth must be kept from the unwashed masses, making their ruling of its nobility impossible!
    
###### ID 310376886
> The class structure was therefore the result of the different metals the gods had put into individual souls—gold for rulers, silver for auxiliaries, and iron and bronze for farmers and artisans. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=965))
    
### CHAPTER 4 Sun Tzu and Machiavelli
###### ID 321186700
> War was denounced as not only uncivilized, wasteful, and destructive, but also fundamentally irrational. In particular, it was an offense against economics. This was put most succinctly by John Stuart Mill in 1848: “It is commerce which is rapidly rendering war obsolete, by strengthening and multiplying the personal interests which act in natural opposition to it.” ([Location 1987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=1987))
    
###### ID 321186701
> Historians picked the most obvious and thus missed out on so many more. As Berlin put it, “No theories can possibly fit the immense variety of possible human behavior, the vast multiplicity of minute, undiscoverable causes and effects which form that interplay of men and nature which history purports to record.”10 ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F3D4IVG&location=2097))
