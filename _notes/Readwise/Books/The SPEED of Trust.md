> The problem in organizations, however, is that many “ethics” solutions focus on compliance. The compliance definition of “ethics” is not one of integrity or integratedness; it is a watered-down, devalued definition that essentially means “follow the rules.” Ethics training, therefore, is often focused exclusively on conformity to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory and rules-based legislation—and not on clarifying values and fostering integrity to those values and to enduring principles. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MGATWG&location=1518))

> As a result, companies have huge, complex policy manuals. In addition, people can be duplicitous or even brutal in how they treat others, but unless they’re caught fudging on an expense account or violating some other measurable rule, as long as they’re getting results, most companies typically won’t do anything about it.

> impression. It’s possible to tell the truth, but leave the wrong impression. And that’s not being honest. ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MGATWG&location=1537))

> Congruence. “Integrity” comes from the same Latin root as the words “integrated” and “integer.” A person has integrity when there is no gap between intent and behavior . . . when he or she is whole, seamless, the same—inside and out. This kind of authenticity is what I call “congruence.” And it is congruence—not compliance—that will ultimately create credibility and trust.

> The lesson from the story is this: If you’re not a caring person now—but you desire to be a caring person—then go out and behave in caring ways. If you’re not an honest person now—but you desire to be honest—then go out and behave in honest ways. Just do what caring and honest people do. It may take time, but as you do these things, you can behave yourself into the kind of person you want to be.
