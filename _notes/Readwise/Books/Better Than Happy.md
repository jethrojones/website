###### ID 310376911

###### ID 310376913

###### ID 315753985

###### ID 315753991
> The Lord knows what will make it harder for us to achieve a joyful life and what will strengthen us spiritually, and that is why He’s given us His counsel. Some people call His words commandments.

###### ID 315753993
> Godly sorrow is not an intense, shame-filled, self-loathing depression. It is the opposite of that. It is not, “I’m sorry I’m so terrible.” It is, “I’m sorry … that’s not who I am.” ([Location 1762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HJRN7BJ&location=1762))

([Location 1925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HJRN7BJ&location=1925))
    
###### ID 315754001
> That’s how I feel about love. It’s my right, and I get to love anyone I want to. And loving people who are not loving me (at least in that moment) is one of my favorite things to do. ([Location 2008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09HJRN7BJ&location=2008))

###### ID 315754003
