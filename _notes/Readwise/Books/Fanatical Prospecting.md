> Superstars are relentless, unstoppable prospectors. They are obsessive about keeping their pipeline full of qualified prospects. They prospect anywhere and anytime—constantly turning over rocks looking for their next opportunity. They prospect day and night—unstoppable and always on. Fanatical! ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01617VD3I&location=453))

> They don't make excuses: “Oh, this is not a good time to call because they might be at lunch.” They don't complain: “Nobody is calling me back.” They don't whine: “The leads are bad.” They don't live in fear: “What if she says no?” Or “What if this is a bad time?” They don't procrastinate: “I don't have time right now. I'll catch up tomorrow.” They prospect when times are good because they know that a rainy day is right around the corner. They prospect when times are bad because they know that fanatical prospecting is the key to survival. They prospect even when they don't feel like prospecting because they are driven to keep their pipeline full.

> Here's a math question: Becky has 30 prospects in her pipeline. Her closing percentage is 10 percent. She closes one deal. How many prospects remain in her pipe? Most people answer 29. The real answer is 20. So why 20? Here's the math. Becky has a 1 in 10 probability of closing a deal. That means on average she will close only one deal out of 10 prospects she puts in her pipeline. The net result is when she closes one deal, the other nine are no longer viable prospects. This means her pipeline will be reduced by 10 prospects rather than one. She must now replace those 10 prospects to keep her pipeline full. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01617VD3I&location=878))

> Subject: COO—The Toughest Job in the Bank Lawrence, Ernst & Young recently reported that the COO has the toughest role in the C-suite. The COOs I work with tell me that the increasing complexity of the banking environment has made their job harder and more stressful than ever. My team and I help COOs like you reduce complexity and stress with strategies to optimize growth and profit, mitigate credit risk, allocate resources effectively, and minimize regulatory surprises. While I don't know if we are a good fit for your bank, why don't we schedule a short call to help me learn more about your unique challenges? From there we can decide if it makes sense to set up a deeper conversation. How about next Thursday at 3:00 PM?

> Outlearn = Outearn Cicero said, “The cultivation of the mind is as necessary as food to the body.” Gandhi said, “We should live as if we will die tomorrow and learn as if we will live forever.” In sales, and in life, when you outlearn your competitors (and peers), you'll outearn them. People who invest in learning are more motivated, develop a stronger belief system, and are invariably more successful than their peers.

When you face your Goliath, when you set your goals, when you face fear, rejection, and adversity; when you're tired, worn out, and have the choice to go home or make one more call—the only question that really matters is: How bad do you want it?
