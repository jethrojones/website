> Typically managers can articulate the more pronounced differences between their top and low performers; however, when it comes to their most influential, impactful players, the top of the top, there seems to be an ineffable quality about them. There is a certain je ne sais quoi in how they approach their jobs and an art form to the way they contribute.

> The Impact Players in our study see everyday challenges as opportunities. To Impact Players, unclear direction and changing priorities are chances to add value. They are energized by the messy problems that would enervate or foil others. Lack of clarity doesn’t paralyze them; it provokes them. Invitations to make changes are intriguing, not intimidating. Perhaps most fundamentally, they don’t see problems as distractions from their job; rather, they are the job—not just their job, but everyone’s job.

> For example, when Jethro Jones interviewed for the job of principal at Tanana Middle School in Fairbanks, Alaska, he learned that the school was being considered for closure due to declining enrollment. The school would continue operations for the next year or two, but without a major turnaround and increased enrollment, it would be shuttered. Unsurprisingly, the staff felt hopeless and were fairly pessimistic about the school’s future. But Jethro accepted the job, sensing an opportunity to innovate on behalf of the students. In his first staff meeting, he acknowledged the challenges, but told the staff, “We’re in a great position. Everyone predicts that this school will be closed. We have nothing to lose, which gives us a unique opportunity to take risks and do things differently.”5 Willing to give the new principal a chance, the staff began thinking of ways they could personalize the learning experience for each student, which Jethro supported with staff training and other resources. Instead of feeling threatened by the possibility of the school’s closing, the staff became energized and got students involved, too. In collaboration with the teachers, the students built hockey rinks, repaired furniture, and made escape rooms. They started programs and clubs; soon they had a dance team, a service organization, and programs to teach sign language, raise awareness about suicide, and prevent bullying. By treating this threat as an opportunity for reinvention, the team at Tanana Middle School changed the school’s trajectory. Unbeknownst to them, in the process they built a model for personalized learning that was then replicated across the district. Tanana Middle School is still open today and thriving under new leadership. Though the threat of school closure has evaporated, the mindset of opportunity… ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R3WH6N7&location=257))
