> I’m pretty sure the first email we sent was something like: “So we haven’t tried to sell you anything in six months, but today we’d be silly if we didn’t reach out to tell you about our new product and why we think you’re going to love it.” ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=108))
    
###### ID 471577848
> Today, people want to buy from people. We want to work with people who we know, like, and trust. And this is why I believe that the clearest path to success in marketing (if your goal is to build awareness for your brand) is to start with the founder. A founder with a brand gives your marketing efforts superpowers. A founder brand builds trust, creates lasting relationships, and conveys expertise, leadership, content, and personality. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=120))

> Level 1: Master the art of storytelling. Develop and refine your story. Level 2: Become a publisher. Don’t wait for people to tell your story. Get on the offensive and go out and tell it. Level 3: Master the feedback loop. What can you learn from your metrics? Which metrics matter? ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=227))
    
###### ID 471577850
> The key to using storytelling in your brand is to know how to tell your story and target the delivery of the story to the correct audience, to the niche that wants the product or service your business provides. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=273))
    
###### ID 471577851
> I’ve found answering these six questions to be a great framework for laying out the key ingredients in the company and founder story: What is the founder’s (your) backstory? What’s the problem your business exists to solve? Who’s the villain your customers are facing? What’s the solution that you offer? What are the benefits of using your product? What’s life like before and after using your product? ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=287))
    
###### ID 480627172
> What’s the problem? Is it a product that doesn’t exist, and you had to invent it? A service that you needed and couldn’t find? A way to solve a common problem or concern? Who’s the villain? Or what? Why is this a problem? Why would someone want to rid themselves of this villain? ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=339))
    
###### ID 480627173
> Plain and simple, how do you solve this problem? What product or service are you specifically proposing to provide, and how does it solve the problem? ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=342))
    
###### ID 480627174
> State the clear and compelling benefits of using your product. How do you make your customers’ lives better? Don’t focus on features but focus on the selfish benefits people will get by using your product. How do you help them make money? Save money? Save time? Increase status? Improve health? ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=343))
    
###### ID 480627175
> What is the market I want to enter? Who is the target customer? Be as specific as possible. Don’t say “women,” say, “women, twenty-five to thirty, college educated, living in the suburbs, not married, no children.” You want a group small enough that you can get their attention, but big enough that they can reach out to others. The best way to pick a niche is to work backward. Based on what you can offer today, who is your ideal customer? Not based on the features and benefits and future products you might be building. I want you to be honest with yourself. As of right now, who is a good fit to buy your product? What problem are you trying to solve and why? Be specific. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=521))
    
###### ID 471577852
> When I write an explainer, they are two to three sentences long. The perfect length for a short conversation. The format is like this: You know how __________________ (insert the problem or old way of doing things that you aim to change)? Instead of __________________ (problem/old way), we have a __________________ (solution/new way). We call it __________________ (name of the product or brand).

> Another thing I like to have founders (and the entire company) do is update their social media banners to promote products, launches, or upcoming events, like Shopify President Harley Finkelstein is doing here to promote Shopify’s annual conference Unite: ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=878))

###### ID 471577857
> The team kept a running list of topics and ideas that they collaborated with Ben on, and he’d pull that up and record. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=1159))

###### ID 471577860
> Ben Jabbawy shared his thoughts about the editing process by saying this: “It’s highly unlikely that the reason your podcasts fail is because of the quality of the production. It’s way more likely it fails because you as the founder just don’t commit and don’t turn it into a habit.” ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=1202))

> Until people know you, they will come for the guests. So if you have an industry with lots of interesting characters, bring them on your podcast. ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=1281))

###### ID 471577865
> I usually recommend creating two articles from each podcast episode. First, a promo-style post, which recaps the episode and includes the full transcript and any show notes or links; and second, an “evergreen”-style post, which is more about longer tail traffic and hijacking one of the topics from your podcast episode to turn into a useful post for your website visitors in a way that almost has nothing to do with the fact that you have a podcast—the ([Location 1311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=1311))

> Hit the road and go on other podcasts, connecting with their audiences. As you refine your public speaking skills (and podcasting is a great way to do that) and your show grows, you’ll hopefully start to get more requests from other podcast hosts to go on their shows.

###### ID 471577869
> A final trick is to use the concept of surprise and delight to create superfans. Reach out to followers and give them a little gift. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=1371))

> Being an expert in your industry is great. Being obnoxious as to how knowledgeable you are will turn people off. The goal is not to tell people you’re an expert.

> Instead, attend the event and reach out to speakers on the agenda and offer to interview them on-site for your podcast during the event. This is one of the best ways to (1) get content from an event, (2) connect with industry influencers, and (3) tap into the event and “hijack” it for the benefit of your podcast.

> As a result, I focused on always trying to find little ways to optimize and grow my podcast audience. But that thinking about the ROI was wrong. The real ROI of creating a podcast today is that it can be a Trojan horse for all of your marketing content.

> Develop your story as the founder, including the backstory of what problem you are solving and why. Determine your niche by specifically determining your target customer. This needs to be small and very well-defined. Identify your villain. What problem are you solving? Clarify your explainer. This will allow you to be able to capture attention and start a conversation with your target audience because they can understand exactly what you are selling. Develop your one-liner, the one sentence that becomes your catchphrase and is sprinkled everywhere until your audience knows it by heart.

Go on the road with your brand and story, sharing it at every possible public speaking event. ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PMHFJLK&location=1814))
