> Greater appreciation for the greater universe will also help us to live more righteously in our own tiny universes of daily life. Likewise, a better understanding of God’s governance of the vast galaxies can lead to our better self-governance. (Page 4)

> The resources so necessary to sustain human life are so generously provided on this particular planet; unless they are mismanaged, we are told that there is “enough and to spare” (D&C 104:17 (Page 5)

> The Lord even invites us to “ponder in [our] hearts” that particular parable (v. 62). Such pondering does not mean idle speculation, but rather, patient and meek anticipation of further revelations. Besides, God gave only partial disclosure—“not all”—to Moses, with “only an (Page 10)

> Science . . . is concerned with the what, when, and how. It does not, and indeed cannot, answer within its method (powerful as that method is), why.” (Page 12)

> The same divine design in the universe is miniatured in the lilies of the field (see Matthew 6:28–29; 3 Nephi 13:28–29; D&C 84:82). (Page 13)

> Wendell Berry writes: “Whoever really has considered the lilies of the field or the birds of the air and pondered the improbability of their existence in this warm world within the cold and empty stellar distances will hardly balk at the turning of water into wine—which was, after all, a very small miracle. We forget the greater and still continuing miracle by which water (with soil and sunlight) is turned into grapes.” (Page 13)

> Unsurprisingly, therefore, the power of godliness revealed in lilies is likewise revealed in the ordinances of His gospel (see D&C 84:20). Thematically, these ordinances concern our cleansing, covenanting, obeying, and preparing—all behaviorally necessary in order for us to be empowered to make the homeward journey. (Page 13)

> Even so, in the midst of our feeling overcome by the wonder and awe, the “cares of the world” can overcome us (see D&C 39: 9).

We can become estranged from the Creator, who then seems like a far, distant star: “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (Mosiah 5:13).
