> Even if the training was engaging—here’s reason number two—you likely didn’t spend much time figuring out how to translate the new insights into action so you’d do things differently. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUIBBZI&location=139))

> The third reason is that the seemingly simple behaviour change of giving a little less advice and asking a few more questions is surprisingly difficult. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUIBBZI&location=141))

> when you’re asking questions, you might feel less certain about whether you’re being useful, the conversation can feel slower and you might feel like you’ve somewhat lost control of the conversation (and indeed you have. That’s called “empowering”). Put like that, it doesn’t sound like that good an offer. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUIBBZI&location=144))

> may find that you’ve become part of an overdependent team. There’s a double whammy here. First, you’ve trained your people to become excessively reliant on you, a situation that turns out to be disempowering for them and frustrating for you. And then as an unwelcome bonus, because you’ve been so successful in creating this dependency that you now have too much work to do, you may also have become a bottleneck in the system.

> Coaching for Performance vs. Coaching for Development Some institutions distinguish between coaching for performance and coaching for development. Coaching for performance is about addressing and fixing a specific problem or challenge. It’s putting out the fire or building up the fire or banking the fire. It’s everyday stuff, and it’s important and necessary. Coaching for development is about turning the focus from the issue to the person dealing with the issue, the person who’s managing the fire.

The people side—any issues with team members/colleagues/other departments/bosses/customers/clients. And patterns—if there’s a way that you’re getting in your own way, and not showing up in the best possible way.

> The simple act of adding “for you” to the end of as many questions as possible is an everyday technique for making conversations more development- than performance-oriented. Yes, the problems still get sorted out. But with “for you” there’s often additional personal insight, and with personal insight comes increased growth and capability.
