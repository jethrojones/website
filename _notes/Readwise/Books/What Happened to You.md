> I politely declined. Several weeks later, I received another call. “Oprah is inviting you to a daylong retreat at her farm in Indiana. There will be two other people, you, and Oprah. We want to brainstorm solutions to the issue of child abuse.” This time, with a chance to meaningfully contribute, I accepted. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=100))
    - Note: Wow, declined an invite from Oprah?! Who would do that? This man who understood his value and vision.

> Oprah and I are convinced that asking the fundamental question “What happened to you?” can help each of us know a little more about how experiences—both good and bad—shape us. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=143))
    - Note: But what if we don’t give power to the experiences? Do they still shape us? Is it impossible to avoid?

###### ID 270990681
> All experience is processed from the bottom up, meaning, to get to the top, “smart” part of our brain, we have to go through the lower, not-so-smart part. This sequential processing means that the most primitive, reactive part of our brain is the first part to interpret and act on the information coming in from our senses. Bottom line: Our brain is organized to act and feel before we think. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=286))
    
###### ID 270990682
> This is also how our brain develops—sequentially, from the bottom up. The developing infant acts and feels, and these actions and feelings help organize how they will begin to think. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=289))
    
###### ID 270990683
> The brain categorizes every bit of sensory input and sends it “up the triangle” to other parts of the brain to integrate and process it further. This creates an increasingly rich and detailed version of any experience, as various inputs become linked based on how they’re sorted. For example, the brain sends some visual input to the same areas it sends auditory (sound), tactile (touch), and olfactory (smell) sensations that come in at exactly the same time. These different sensations—the sights, sounds, smells, and movements of the same experience—then become connected. This is the beginning of making sense of the world.

> The sense of self informs every relationship or decision we make as we move through life. And when children don’t feel respected by the decisions of their parents, their beliefs about how they are valued are crushed. Kris and Daisy were the first children ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=400))
    
###### ID 270990685
> When a new relationship enters the picture, two things happen. First, the child—and this is true even of babies—begins asking internally, “Who is this person, and what is this?” Second, they feel the shift of their parent’s attention away from them and onto this other person. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=406))
    - Note: We are wired to be connected to our parents who created us. We struggle when someone new enters the picture. There are so many stories of people doing crazy things for their parents’ attention.

    - Note: My problem is the question what happened to you sets you up as the victim with no control over how you respond or control the narrative. To me, it’s no different from what’s wrong with you? 
      What’s a better question to ask? 
      What have you experienced? 
      How can your experiences shape your life?

> As we grow up, we find our own set of regulating rhythms and activities. For some of us, it is walking. For others, it’s doing needlework or riding a bike. Everyone has their go-to options when they feel out of sync, anxious, or frustrated. The common element is rhythm. Rhythm is regulating.

> will anticipate good things from people. We project that expectation in our interactions with others and thereby actually elicit good from them. Our internal view of the world becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy; we project what we expect, and that helps elicit what we expect.

###### ID 270990691
> The Tree of Regulation is comprised of a set of neural networks our body uses to help us process and respond to stress. We tend to use the word stress in negative ways, but stress is merely a demand on one or more of our body’s many physiological systems.

> This is one of the central problems in our society; we have too many parents caring for children with inadequate supports. The result is what you would expect. An overwhelmed, exhausted, dysregulated parent will have a hard time regulating a child consistently and predictably. This can impact the child in two really important ways. First, it affects the development ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=642))
    
###### ID 270990693
> The second major problem has to do with that process of creating connections about relationships. If, while the infant is creating her working model of the world, the caregiver responds in unpredictable ways, or is episodically rough, frustrated, cold, or absent, the child begins to create a different sort of worldview.

> also remember that humans are emotionally “contagious”; we sense the distress of others. Imagine a child in a home with a frustrated, angry father who has no job prospects, is disrespected in the community due to his status or skin color, and comes home feeling impotent, defeated.

It may be a pleasurable feeling, but you’re not necessarily going to become addicted. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=767))

###### ID 270990702
> Whereas the physiology of the arousal response is to optimize fight or flight, the physiology of dissociation is to help us rest, replenish, survive injury, and tolerate pain. Where arousal increases heart rate, dissociation decreases it. Where arousal sends blood to the muscles, dissociation keeps blood in the trunk, to minimize blood loss in case of injury. Arousal releases adrenaline; dissociation releases the body’s own pain killers, enkephalins and endorphins.

###### ID 270990703
> Now, as we’ve suggested before, what is adaptive for children living in chaotic, violent, trauma-permeated environments becomes maladaptive in other environments—especially school. The hypervigilance of the Alert state is mistaken for ADHD; the resistance and defiance of Alarm and Fear get labeled as oppositional defiant disorder; flight behavior gets them suspended from school; fight behavior gets them charged with assault. The pervasive misunderstanding of trauma-related behavior has a profound effect on our educational, mental health, and juvenile justice systems.

Hundreds of years of internalizing the trauma of racism, segregation, brutality, fear, and the dismantling of the nuclear family—all of it replicated and repeated over and over at the micro level of the individual and eventually seen and felt at the macro level of society.

In brief, a parent is instructed to not give any expression when interacting with their baby. They are asked to be disengaged, passive, and cool toward the child.

The pillars of traditional healing were 1) connection to clan and the natural world; 2) regulating rhythm through dance, drumming, and song; 3) a set of beliefs, values, and stories that brought meaning to even senseless, random trauma; and 4) on occasion, natural hallucinogens or other plant-derived substances used to facilitate healing with the guidance of a healer or elder.

> This is the start of a toxic mismatch between the child’s capabilities and the unrealistic expectations of an education system that is all too often underresourced, developmentally uninformed, and trauma-ignorant. Even if the child “progresses” to the next grade, they are still behind, and this sets them up to fail. Year after year, they fall further and further behind. Their delays in developing skills, together with their trauma-related symptoms, begin to attract mental health labels (see Figure 6). The hypervigilance from their sensitized stress response is labeled ADHD; their predictable efforts to self-regulate—by rocking, chewing gum, doodling, daydreaming, listening to music, tapping their pencil, etc.—are prohibited. They will be labeled, medicated, excluded, punished, perhaps expelled, and then, all too often, arrested. When they try to avoid the constant humiliation of school, they’re charged with truancy; when they try to flee and the school staff tries to stop them, a restraint incident results in charges of assault—against the child. This is the school-to-prison pipeline. ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087D5YQXB&location=2813))

The good news is that when schools do learn about the effects of trauma and make some simple changes in how they evaluate, support, and teach, they see dramatic improvements in academic achievement and decreases in challenging and disruptive behaviors. If the classroom uses regulatory strategies, the teachers are supported and respected, the needs and strengths of children are identified and addressed, the outcomes are much better.
