> Your Sage’s five great powers are (1) to Explore with great curiosity and an open mind; (2) to Empathize with yourself and others and bring compassion and understanding to any situation; (3) to Innovate and create new perspectives and outside-the-box solutions; (4) to Navigate and choose a path that best aligns with your deeper underlying values and mission; and (5) to Activate and take decisive action without the distress, interference, or distractions of the Saboteurs.

> The Judge warns you that if you empathize with yourself or others’ avoidable hardships, you are encouraging more of the behavior that caused the hardship. You’d better punish rather than empathize, it says. A key fallacy of this argument is the belief that empathizing with pain means condoning the action that brought the pain about.

> visualize the other person as a child in her true essence before she started getting weighted down by Saboteurs. Visualize her eyes and facial expression, her manner of carrying herself, and what used to light her up as a child. Visualize her hold her puppy, snuggle with her mom, or chase a butterfly. Trust that the same essence is still inside her, underneath her Saboteurs. ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007R0IQ70&location=1142))

> The most visible manifestation of this is that we yawn when another yawns, or cringe when we see another in physical pain. The less visible manifestation is that energy, mood, and even PQ levels can be contagious. For example, it’s more likely that your own Saboteurs will come out swinging if someone approaches you with his or her Judge in charge.
