> Creating difference, on the other hand, is about seeing things in a whole new light. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8W7HYO&location=132))

> THE TEN CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENCE THINKERS They practice empathy because they care enough to make an impact. They have a clear sense of the change they want to make in the world. They are impatient about tactics and endlessly patient about implementing their strategy. They ask the right questions, and that means that they talk more than twice as much as they listen, because talking takes guts. Mostly, they ignore those who offer empty criticism. They watch what people do and don’t just believe what people tell them. They innovate and create at the edges, ignoring the market of everyone. They make products for their customers, instead of trying to find customers for their products. They understand that they need to give people a story to tell—a ‘you’ve gotta see this’ moment. They work hard to change how people feel, by creating intangible value that gives them an emotional point of difference. They understand that trust is their second-most valuable asset. The first is the willingness to be wrong for the right reason. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8W7HYO&location=163))

> Now more than ever before, the ideas, businesses and brands that succeed are the ones that help to reinforce, enhance and shape the cultures, beliefs, aspirations and behaviours of their audience. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8W7HYO&location=199))

> What’s working now is doing exactly the opposite: figuring out what people want and finding ways to delight one person at a time, one person who is thrilled to talk about you to her friends, essentially turning the funnel on its head.

###### ID 234483280
> Actually, marketing is, and has always been, a transfer of emotion. It’s about changing how people feel and, in turn, helping them to fall in love with something, or maybe just a little bit more in love with themselves.

> The secret of disruptive innovations and business models isn’t that they disrupt an industry; it’s that they disrupt people. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8W7HYO&location=295))
    
###### ID 234483282
> While industries work on the assumption that the larvae of today will just be bigger caterpillars tomorrow, the disruptor imagines butterflies. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8W7HYO&location=298))
