> What the conspiracy theorist’s special insight does not ever seem to reveal to him, though, is why? Why would nations and corporations give up their sovereignty? For money they already have? Wouldn’t they rather control their own destinies than become powerless pawns of this shadowy global cabal? This is a pretty large and glaring question, and it’s one for which the conspiracy theorists don’t seem to have a very persuasive answer.

> For nearly 200 years, the Knights Templar was one of the most powerful institutions in the world. Economists have noted that they appear to have been the world’s first true multinational corporation. Eventually they were able to self-fund through investment and lending. Unfortunately, this very success is what led to their very public downfall. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RTRNK1&location=111))

> The Theory Long the subjects of conspiracy theory, the infamous Rothschild family is said to have been making international loans to finance wars in Europe since the 1700s. Believers claim that each time the family financed a war, the debts they held effectively gave them control over the governments on both sides—giving them nearly unlimited influence on every major nation in the world by the late 1800s. The Jewish Rothschild family is claimed to have financed both Nazi Germany and the creation of the state of Israel, profiting massively each time. Today they are described by some to be the single most powerful entity on the planet. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RTRNK1&location=145))

Their investments greatly stabilized various currencies by facilitating international trade and credit. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075RTRNK1&location=161))

> The Bilderbergers Date: 1954–Present Location: Europe and North America The Conspirators: Bilderberg conference attendees The Victims: Innocent citizens worldwide The Theory Once a year, according to conspiracy theorists anyway, scores of the world’s most powerful leaders in business, finance, militaries, and arts meet at a different luxury hotel. Although members of this Bilderberg Group—named for the hotel where they held their very first meeting—claim that they meet merely to exchange ideas and discuss solutions to problems faced by many nations, conspiracy theorists charge that they are actually the secret world government. The belief is that the power brokers hold these highly-secure, closed meetings to decide all the national foreign and domestic policies that all attending nations must abide by. Attendees then return to their home countries with their new orders in hand, and their governments then carry these orders out—no matter how nefarious they may be. Have we all been duped? Are the conspiracy theorists correct, and this is how the real policies of the world’s nations are decided? Are elections just fictions, and world leaders just pawns of the Bilderbergers?

> Today the number is rising again as more manufacturers get back into the business, driven by major public health initiatives to sell hundreds of millions of annual doses in poor countries, as well as newer vaccines such as hepatitis B and HPV that can be sold at a profit in wealthier countries. In 2014 Merck sold $1.7 billion in HPV vaccines, while the entire rest of their vaccine product line treating measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox brought in only $1.4 billion.

> A crucial point is the conspiracy theorists’ use of the phrase “official story.” These are weasel words, used disparagingly to cast doubt without actually saying anything of substance. Another weasel phrase used often in anti-government conspiracy theories is “the government’s version of events.” These two phrases are used calculatingly. When conspiracy theorists refer to the Warren Commission Report as an “official story” they do so to give the impression that other equally plausible stories exist as well, and that this one is tainted by its association with a powerful government capable of creating false narratives.
