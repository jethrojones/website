> I learned that there truly is a return and report system in our present life, which we don’t use properly. I recommend that we get used to doing this in our daily and family prayers and in our relationships, that we practice returning and reporting. “This is what you asked me to do today, this is what I did, and this is what happened”—and then plead for eternal intervention in the details.

> It wasn’t until later that I began to understand that entering another person’s body is very invasive, and a righteous spirit always seeks permission if it is ever necessary. Evil spirits wait for opportunities when we are spiritually weak or after we have rendered ourselves vulnerable by disobedience to God’s laws, and they enter into us in an act of spiritual violence.

> I thought “I” was my body, and I was growing through my experiences. I learned that “I” am in fact my spirit self, who already has a godly nature, and rather than overcoming my body, as in beating it into submission, my struggles were engineered to elevate my body to the stature of my spirit.

###### ID 38689500
> After this life-altering experience, I began getting information from God to give to my clients. I would upon occasion have to wait for them to stop talking so that I could tell them what I had just learned. Over time, as I became more sensitive to spiritual things and more obedient in my response to them, my discernment improved. My insight into their lives improved. I sometimes saw in vision the things that had happened to these clients, and my compassion and understanding was great for them. I couldn’t help but be sympathetic.

> Our local civic leaders had tried to organize relief efforts, but that effort expired when the foreign troops took over. Only the Church and our Christian friends remained organized and committed. ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AA4EVHY&location=2881))

> We worked with them and rode in their vehicles to and from assignments. We worked our way down side streets, through the residential areas, approaching Immigration Canyon. We stopped at every home to assist people, promising that other rescuers were close behind us. We were still in the residential area, a few miles from the Point of the Mountain, when I realized that the view looked wrong. There were no more trees or power poles to be seen toward the south. We slowed down and approached with caution. We could not believe our eyes. Ahead of us, the ground had fallen away. I walked up to the edge and peered down into the hole.

> This was the first city the troops had entered that didn’t just give up and hand control of civil matters over to the foreign troops. ([Location 2954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AA4EVHY&location=2954))

> They proclaimed with great fanfare that this was the beginning of a “new world order.” They claimed that everything had changed in the world. For the first time in memory, the United States was no longer able to meet its own basic needs, and the rest of the world was welcoming us into this new world. The logic they used was, “Why else would they be here with food and medicine, instead of with guns and bombs.” Our own government seemed to be urging all US citizens to just submit and accept the changes in civil authority.

> When a person contracted the plague, they got many small pox marks on their skin, similar to pimples. These grew in size and quantity until nearly their whole body was covered by them. They grew very sick quickly. The itching and pain was severe. Shortly before death, the pox erupted and oozed. This fluid was extremely contagious. Everyone who touched it got sick.

###### ID 38689509
> But what I did see was that we had spiritually marked ourselves. This marking began perhaps thirty years before the tribulations, when the counterculture of political correctness began, and the assault on Christian values and traditions began. At first it seemed so ridiculous that it was harmless, kind of like a disease to which we were all immune. Soon, however, it was recolored to equal compassion, fairness, acceptance, tolerance, and equality. From there it evolved into a power with the ability to take any truth and repaint it as a lie, to take any lie and relabel it as truth. Subscribing to this thinking and tuning out the Holy Spirit marked us with darkness. It was a mark we placed upon our own soul. It was not visible to another human, but those who had marked themselves in this way could not discern the Holy Spirit, and they found themselves completely reliant upon the foreign troops, who truthfully had no long-term interest in their survival. When the tribulations began, it was nearly impossible for those who had received the mark of the beast to see God’s hand reaching out to lead them to safety. They were blinded to the only thing that could redeem them, and many were eventually lost. ([Location 3061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AA4EVHY&location=3061))

> I remember most of the names of the dead, and the survivors, because we repeated them among ourselves many times and prayed for their families. But I have chosen to not ever reveal their names. ([Location 3114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AA4EVHY&location=3114))
    - Note: I am sure ot was or will be amazing hearing those names called in general conference.

> Our leaders urged us to not worry about the times, world events, national intrigue, or wars, but to wait upon the Lord and just keep moving forward. ([Location 3676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AA4EVHY&location=3676))

> “It just came into my heart that I already knew I would arrive in Zion, and if the Lord had not yet provided medicine, then I obviously didn’t need it. I knew it was true. I felt vitality come back into my body, and I got out of bed. ([Location 3734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AA4EVHY&location=3734))
    
###### ID 38689513
> We had the priesthood power, but not the spiritual maturity and understanding to use it flawlessly. Like this fine brother, we had to learn how to be of perfect faith, and how to release our grip on “things” as our salvation.

> The portal belonged to me, and spiritually speaking, was a part of me. After I learned to use its full capabilities I was able to see anything I wished. It could only be used for inspired purposes and in fulfilling the assignments of the Lord. By looking into the surface I could view any event or place merely by wishing to. At first, I could only view things as they presently were, but over time I learned to use it to see the past and the future as it pertained to my assignments. I could also contact other translated people and see them through the portal. If necessary, I could speak to them and they to me. If I walked into the glass, I would instantly be taken to that location. I could hand things to them and receive things from them without actually going there myself. Like the pillars of light that had protected us on the last leg of our journey, this portal also had a healing and rejuvenating property. Being near it, or especially passing through it, would heal anyone’s body and soul who came with me. This portal was tuned to myself and would only respond to me—though it would show other people what I was seeing if I included them. I could also bring other people and other things through the portal with me if it was the Lord’s will. I had the impression that it was alive—a living thing, full of truth and understanding and immense power. It was not a person, or a soul, but it was living in the way that the earth is living. It contained all of the history of the workmanship of God and could show it to me when my requests were righteous. I also knew that it was eternal in nature and had been a part of my life before I was born and would be a part of my life eternally thereafter. It operated exactly as the one I had seen in my premortal room. I could view or study anything I wished merely by wondering about it. If I needed to handle something, it would present a solid representation of that thing, which I could handle and operate. I fully understood that it was for the work of the Lord and not for my entertainment, and that I could not, nor would I ever consider, entertaining myself with it or gratifying curiosity. The only limitation to the portal was my own faith and my understanding of how to use it. No matter how many wonders and gifts of God we obtained, it required experience and inspiration to use them fully. I do not recall ever receiving something from God and immediately having full command of it. It took personal diligence and spiritual effort to grow into these gifts. I used it many times to go on assignment for the Lord. Before I left, I took time to study everything and everyone I would minister to, including their history. This information came to me merely by wondering about it. I took it in with my eyes and with my soul in floods of information. When I was prepared, I would walk into the surface of the portal and it would take me there instantly. I could complete my mission, and merely by wanting to return, I would take one step… ([Location 4107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AA4EVHY&location=4107))

> It felt like springtime in the air, but it should have been sub-arctic winter. I also knew that this road, the three peaks, and where we were going had been under a hundred feet of ice for several millennia. Only since the temperature of the earth had warmed, and the ice had melted, had this place become accessible once again.
