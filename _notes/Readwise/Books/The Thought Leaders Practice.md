###### ID 234482431
> Subject-matter experts tend to develop their expertise within a certain market segment. This does not mean that they should limit that expertise to that market only. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KIDFZ9E&location=832))
    
###### ID 234482432
> For many, the first cross-over market requires a certain leap of faith. Typically people have spent so long in one particular market that they are squarely in the centre of their comfort zone. Our advice: take the leap! ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KIDFZ9E&location=836))

###### ID 234482438
> For many service-based professionals, the idea of selling is completely alien. They will tell you, often proudly, that they have never had to sell a day in their life.

###### ID 234482443
