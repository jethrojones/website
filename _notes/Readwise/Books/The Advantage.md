> Because I’m not a quantitative researcher, the conclusions I draw here are not based on reams of statistics or finely crunched data, but rather on my observations as a consultant over the past twenty years. But as Jim Collins, the research giant, once told me, qualitative field research is just as reliable as the quantitative kind, as long as clients and readers attest to its validity. And I’m happy to say that based on my experience with executives and their organizations, the principles in this book have proven to be as reliable as they are simple.

> The single greatest advantage any company can achieve is organizational health. Yet it is ignored by most leaders even though it is simple, free, and available to anyone who wants it. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=308))
    
###### ID 234481600
> In spite of its undeniable power, so many leaders struggle to embrace organizational health (which I’ll be defining shortly) because they quietly believe they are too sophisticated, too busy, or too analytical to bother with it. In other words, they think it’s beneath them. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=326))
    
###### ID 234481601
> After years of off-site meetings filled with ropes courses and trust-falling exercises, even the most open-minded executives have come to be suspicious of anything that looks or sounds touchy-feely. Combine that with the notion that corporate culture has been reduced to surface-level artifacts like funky office furniture, employee yoga classes, and bring-your-dog-to-work policies, and it’s no wonder that so many leaders have become cynical, even condescending, toward most things related to organizational development.

> Organizational health permeates so many aspects of a company that isolating any one variable and measuring its financial impact is almost impossible to do in a precise way. That certainly doesn’t mean the impact isn’t real, tangible, and massive; it just requires a level of conviction and intuition that many overly analytical leaders have a hard time accepting.

That’s because cohesive leadership teams prevent groupthink, learn from mistakes, and call each other on potential problems before they get out of hand.

> The first is led by a leadership team whose members are open with one another, passionately debate important issues, and commit to clear decisions even if they initially disagree. They call each other out when their behaviors or performance needs correction, and they focus their attention on the collective good of the organization. The second is led by a leadership team whose members are guarded and less than honest with one another. They hold back during difficult conversations, feign commitment, and hesitate to call one another on unproductive behaviors. Often they pursue their own agendas rather than those of the greater organization. The question: What kind of advantage would the first organization have over the second, and how much time and energy would it be worth investing to make this advantage a reality? ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=543))
    
###### ID 234481618
> The importance of leadership team cohesion is almost never overtly disputed, even by the most cynical executives. But somehow, few organizations invest nearly enough time and energy in it, and certainly not with the level of rigor that building a cohesive team requires and deserves.

> A good way to understand a working group is to think of it like a golf team, where players go off and play on their own and then get together and add up their scores at the end of the day. A real team is more like a basketball team, one that plays together simultaneously, in an interactive, mutually dependent, and often interchangeable way. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=576))

###### ID 234481621
> What does this have to do with the size of a team? Plenty. When more than eight or nine people are on a team, members tend to advocate a heck of a lot more than they inquire. This makes sense because they aren’t confident that they’re going to get the opportunity to speak again soon, so they use their scarce floor time to announce their position or make a point. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=601))

###### ID 234481623

> The kind of trust that is necessary to build a great team is what I call vulnerability-based trust. This is what happens when members get to a point where they are completely comfortable being transparent, honest, and naked with one another, where they say and genuinely mean things like “I screwed up,” “I need help,” “Your idea is better than mine,” “I wish I could learn to do that as well as you do,” and even, “I’m sorry.” ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006ORWT3Y&location=681))

> That’s why, during an off-site session, we take teams through a quick exercise where we ask them to tell everyone, briefly, a few things about their lives. In particular, we have them say where they were born, how many siblings they have, where they fall in the order of children, and finally, what the most interesting or difficult challenge was for them as a kid. Again, we’re not interested in their inner childhoods, just what was uniquely challenging for them growing up.

###### ID 234481631
> At first, mining for conflict might seem like stirring the pot and looking for trouble. But it is quite the opposite. By looking for and exposing potential and even subtle disagreements that have not come to the surface, team leaders—and, heck, team members can do it too—avoid the destructive hallway conversations that inevitably result when people are reluctant to engage in direct, productive debate.

> the VP put in place two formal rules. First, if people remained silent during discussions, he would interpret that as disagreement.

###### ID 234481634
> When team members know that they are going to have to stand in front of the people they lead and vouch for a decision, they are much more likely to push back on that decision if they don’t understand it or don’t agree with it. As painful as this may be to a group of executives who are more than ready to get out of a meeting, the only thing more painful than taking additional time to get clarity and commitment is going out into the organization with a confusing and misaligned message.

###### ID 234481636
> Most people assume that the leader of an executive team should be the primary source of accountability—and that’s the norm in most unhealthy organizations—but it isn’t efficient or practical, and it makes little sense. When members of a team go to their leader whenever they see a peer deviate from a commitment that was made, they create a perfect environment for distraction and politics. Colleagues start to wonder who ratted them out, they get resentful of one another, and the team leader finds herself being constantly pulled into situations that could be more quickly and productively solved without her.

> Though I can’t be sure, I suspect that at some point about thirty years ago a cleverly sadistic and antibusiness consultant decided that the best way to really screw up companies was to convince them that what they needed was a convoluted, jargony, and all-encompassing declaration of intent. The more times those declarations used phrases like “world class,” “shareholder value,” and “adding value,” the better. And if companies would actually print those declarations and hang them in their lobbies and break rooms for public viewing, well, that would be a real coup. Even if my historical suspicions are untrue, it can’t be denied that most mission statements have neither inspired people to change the world nor provided them with an accurate description of what an organization actually does for a living. They certainly haven’t created alignment and clarity among employees. What they have done is make many leadership teams look foolish.

Anything shorter than three months feels like a fire drill, and anything longer than twelve invites procrastination and skepticism about whether the goal will endure. (I’ll wait a few months to focus on that because it will probably change, and, who knows, I might not even be working here then.) Shared across the leadership team. When executives agree on their top priority, they must take collective responsibility for achieving it, even if it seems that the nature of the goal falls within one or two of the executives’ regular areas of ownership.
