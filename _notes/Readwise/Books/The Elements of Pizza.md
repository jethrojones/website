> Let’s say the recipe tells you to mix a dough with 90°F (32°C) water and room temperature flour so the dough temperature right after mixing is about 80°F (27°C). Then, it tells you to let the dough ferment for 2 hours at room temperature, then form dough balls and refrigerate them to make pizza with the next day. See Detail 5 for how to make adjustments in your own kitchen according to climate or season. Keep in mind that yeast dies at around 114°F (46°C), so hot hot water is not a good idea. To help you get consistent, dependable results, I ask you to use a digital probe thermometer to measure water temperature for mixing dough, and to get the dough temperature after the dough is mixed. (A probe thermometer has multiple uses in the kitchen, especially for making sure meats are properly cooked.) My ideal bread dough temperature, for maximum volume and flavor development, is 78°F (26°C) after it is mixed. However, most of the direct pizza doughs in this book use very tiny amounts of yeast, and I have gotten the best results mixing dough that ends up between 80° and 82°F (27° and 28°C), creating a warm, productive environment for the yeast to ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012KJYR3O&location=1030))

> Texture is as important as taste with low- moisture mozzarella. It is nothing if it doesn’t deliver an oozing, elastic, stringy pull when you bite into it. Low-moisture mozz is shredded before topping the pizza, and it melts evenly to cover the pizza in a gooey cheese lava halfway between liquid and solid. Whole-milk low-moisture mozzarella gives the sexiest mouthfeel and the richest flavor compared to low-fat or skim-milk mozzarella (imposters!).

> suggest you mix ingredients as follows: 1 Add water to the dough tub, then stir in the salt until dissolved. 2 Add the yeast. Stir until dissolved. 3 Add the flour and mix the dough by hand. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012KJYR3O&location=1670))

> Then using a pincerlike grip with your thumb and forefinger, squeeze big chunks of dough, tightening your grip to cut through the dough. Do this repeatedly, working through the entire mass of dough. With your other hand, turn the tub while you’re mixing to give your active hand a good angle of attack. Cut through the dough five or six times and fold it over itself a few more times. The fold comes from just reaching under half the dough, stretching it out, and folding it over the remaining half. Repeat this process for just 30 seconds to 1 minute, alternating between cutting and folding. Then you can squeegee the doughy bits off your active hand with your clean hand.

> Write down the time your mix ended and the dough temperature. If the dough temperature is well below the target of 80°F (27°C)—for example, if it came out to 70°F (21°C)—then your dough is going to take longer to develop, and it would be a good idea to find a warm spot for it to bulk ferment. In my rise schedules, the amount of time to get the perfect dough development is based on a room at 70° to 74°F (21° to 23°C) daytime, 67°F (19°C) overnight. Dough expands faster in summer and slower in winter. The dough’s final mix temperature and the ambient room temperature, plus the amount of leavening, will determine the amount of development in the dough. Salt is a factor too, as it slows down the activity of yeast. ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012KJYR3O&location=1724))
