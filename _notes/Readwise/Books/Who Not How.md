## Highlights
###### ID 234480050
> Our public education system is entirely based on “How.” We’re taught from a young age that we need to do everything ourselves. We’re taught that getting help from others is “cheating,” and something we absolutely shouldn’t do. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=202))
    - Note: There are many flaws in our education system and perhaps one of the biggest is the concept of cheating. In reality in hood education, cheating is impossible because where cheating is possible, all the wrong things are in place.

> He lives his own ideas. This is why he didn’t write a single page of this book. He knows that it doesn’t make sense for him to do any “How” that isn’t the absolute best use of his time and talents. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=227))

> Who Not How is truly that simple. You define the vision, find the Who or Whos, and let them create the result. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=243))
    
###### ID 234480054
> That’s what real leadership is: Creating and clarifying the vision (the “what”), and giving that vision greater context and importance (the “why”) for all Whos involved. Once the “what” and “why” have clearly been established, the specified “Who” or “Whos” have all they need to go about executing the “How.” All the leader needs to do at that point is support and encourage the Who(s) through the process.

> According to Kegan, the basest form of psychological development is the Socializing Self, which is when a person operates out of fear, anxiety, and dependence. You don’t make your own decisions. You don’t have your own goals. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=317))

> “I only see my part of the ideation as 50 percent. Once I’ve gotten the idea 50 percent formed, then it’s time to test it on the audience who provide the other 50 percent. Every time I share the initial concept, I’m always surprised by the feedback and comments I get. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=340))

###### ID 234480071
> Our attraction to specific people, according to the Arons, is based on two factors: Desirability: the perceived total amount of self-expansion that is possible for us through that specific relationship. Probability: the perceived likelihood that a close relationship with that specific individual can actually be formed. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=558))
    
###### ID 234480072
> What all of this tells us is that our efficacy, capability, and potential as human beings is not absolute, innate, or fixed. It is always contextual, relational, and fluid. What you can accomplish in relation to some people is very different from what you can do in relation to others. What you can learn and become with some people is different than with others.

###### ID 234480075
> Getting Whos involved in your goals is an investment. Often, we lack the commitment to make such an investment. We aren’t fully sold on our goals ourselves, so why would we include others in our goals? As will be shown throughout this book, it is actually the investment in Whos that strengthens your own commitment to your goals.

###### ID 234480077
> CHAPTER TAKEAWAYS “How” limits you to your own knowledge and capabilities. “How” requires that you be the one to engage your time and attention into the particular task. “How” decreases your Freedom of Time. “Who” immediately connects you with different knowledge, insights, and capability. “Who” is about getting the desired result as effectively as possible. “Who” can immediately free up hundreds of hours, which you can spend in better and more meaningful ways. “Who” expands your vision for what is possible, because you no longer see yourself as the sole means of achieving the result. Self-expansion is a core human motivation, and it occurs through Whos. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=635))

> Take some time to reflect on the following questions: How have you changed over the past five years, when it comes to the types of people you surround yourself with? What things do you no longer tolerate? How have you become a better Who for the people in your life? Dan has a saying for this: “Always be the buyer.” What he means is that, in every situation you’re in, you should be the one who is buying, not selling. The buyer can reject the seller, not the other way around. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=1670))

A moonshot, he said, should first be about solving “a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people.” Second, it should not settle for half-baked measures. It has to provide a “radical solution” that can do away with the problem for good. Teller’s last criteria is the reasonable expectation that technology can actually solve the problem. Moonshots should be as much about pragmatism as they are about dreaming. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=2057))

> The parable of the three bricklayers drives this point even further. One day, Sir Christopher Wren, a 17th-century English architect walked unrecognized among the men who were at work building St. Paul’s cathedral in London, of which he was the designer. “What are you doing?” Wren asked one of the workmen. “I’m a bricklayer. I’m working hard laying bricks to feed my family,” the man replied. “What are you doing?” Wren asked a second. “I’m a builder. I’m building a wall,” the second responded. “What are you doing?” Wren asked a third. “I’m a cathedral builder. I’m building a great cathedral to the Almighty.” Each man did the same job, but from an entirely different purpose. The third bricklayer had an expanded Freedom of Purpose, which transformed everything he did. ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0867ZJ151&location=2107))
