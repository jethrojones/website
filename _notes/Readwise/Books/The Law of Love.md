> Science and the Law of Love Learning about and seeking to live the law of love has opened me up to seeing it everywhere I look. I find this truth everywhere. So did Brigham Young: “I want to say to my friends that we believe in all good. If you can find a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it belongs to our doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it. [The gospel] embraces all morality, all virtue, all light, all intelligence, all greatness, and all goodness. . . . It is our duty and calling . . . to gather up all the truths in the world pertaining to . . . the sciences, and to philosophy, wherever it may be found . . . and bring it to Zion” (Discourses of Brigham Young, selected by John A. Widtsoe [1941], 2, 3, 248). Spirituality needs to be practical, in the dirt. My spirituality is based in science. God is the great Scientist, as the Creator of the universe and everything in it using scientific principles. Some of those principles we understand and many we don’t yet. Science is not a fixed body of knowledge but is continuously evolving. A fascinating book I have enjoyed is The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief, by Francis S. Collins, the scientist who headed up the Human Genome Project. While I may not agree with all his professional views, I respect his journey from disbelief to faith. He was an atheist and claimed it was because of science. But in his work on the DNA sequence, Collins said to himself, this is a place of beauty, a piece of art. This DNA sequence is not a place of randomness. This is intentional, but nothing in evolution says there is intent. The deeper he looked into science, the more beauty he saw and the more intent.

> My assertion of “I don’t know” was really more along the lines of “I don’t want to know.” My conclusion [was] that no thinking scientist could seriously entertain the possibility of God without committing some sort of intellectual suicide. So I gradually shifted from agnosticism to atheism,… ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V3JPW3Y&location=197))

> [But] did I not consider myself a scientist? Does a scientist draw conclusions without considering the data? Could there be a more important question in all of human existence than “Is there a God?” I determined to have a look at the facts, no matter what the outcome. I had started this journey of intellectual exploration to confirm my atheism. That now lay in ruins as . . . many issues forced me… ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V3JPW3Y&location=200))

> The elegance behind life’s complexity is indeed reason for awe, and for belief in God. I was astounded by the elegance of the human DNA code.

> From the NASA photos of the immensity and enormousness of space down to microscopic DNA, I see the beauty of how science is put together at its most fundamental levels. Science is full of wonder beyond our capacity to grasp, from the vastness of the universe to the nanoscience of the subcellular level. I think that science itself is simultaneously getting bigger AND smaller. Bigger because of technology and the work that we’ve done to understand our world, adding to the body of scientific knowledge. But simultaneously science is getting smaller as it becomes clearer that science can’t answer many things about the world. Everything about science is too perfect… ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V3JPW3Y&location=208))

> The opposite condition is called centropy,1 in which nothing ends or corrodes. It’s a perpetual place, an eternal place. It’s science. It’s that place where God and eternal things last forever. And that’s what we seek. That’s the miracle of the Resurrection and all the promises of Christ and His Atonement and healing: that we can be in that place, a centropic place. When I think about Zion, about that celestial space, I realize it has to be full of people who are living the law of love: seeking others’ healing without… ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V3JPW3Y&location=217))

> Latter-day Saint scientist Markus Covert told me that science was able to prove that “chance does not exclude inevitability,” according to Christian de Duve, cowinner of the 1974 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine (“The Constraints of Chance,” Scientific American [Jan. 1996], 112). That is, although the world is random and chaotic, there can also be an inevitable place of order. Both can exist simultaneously. For my friend Markus, that had a big impact. Even though he believes in agency and opposition, and he sees… ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V3JPW3Y&location=223))

> I started to talk about this principle in a scientific way with an atheist friend. I asked him, “What if there is a place of perpetuity?” In this life we know disorder and entropy, but what if there were a place of centropy to which our spirits return? We are of God, with something infinite inside of us. Part of our DNA is this eternal place.
