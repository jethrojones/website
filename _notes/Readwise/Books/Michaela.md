> School history has to be much wider than just preparing pupils for further study, ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=65))
    
###### ID 234483123
> A curriculum that allows pupil choice denies those pupils their right to the most enduring legacies of civilisation and only exposes children to that with which they are already familiar. In contrast, an excellent curriculum curates the best that human civilisation has thought and said about each discipline and takes pupils on a guided tour of these achievements.

###### ID 234483124
> The office staff live and breathe the school’s values and goals as much as the teachers. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=111))
    
###### ID 234483125
> This chapter is about how Michaela teachers work hard to ensure that everything the teachers does has a higher value for the children than the output from the teacher. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=115))
    
###### ID 234483126
> Teachers burn out because they’re worked to the bone. We work hard at Michaela, but it seems easier because everything we do makes sense. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=116))
    
###### ID 234483127
> excuses culture which routinely ignored children’s bad behaviour. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=180))
    
###### ID 234483128
> There’s a reason one of the mantras we have at Michaela is ‘when you fall down, you pick yourself up and you keep on going’. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=220))
    
###### ID 234483129
> We believe our role as teachers is to help develop our children into adults we can admire and respect and that a particular school ethos is required for that to happen for all of the children in our care. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=287))
    
###### ID 234483130
> People often think conservatives must be really stern and boring. But I hope I’m not like that. When people meet me, they often express surprise at the fact that I am actually quite laidback and trusting. It doesn’t really fit with the image of the stern ‘Dragon Lady’ who breathes fire, that some visitors picture in their heads. But that’s part of being a teacher, isn’t it? Putting on an act. It’s not really who I am inside. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=316))
    
###### ID 234483131
> I now think that victimhood culture, lack of family support, inappropriate music choice and friend choice, refusal to take personal responsibility, inability to embrace one’s duty, inability to be grateful for what one has (however little it is), and peer pressure to conform to the ways ‘of the street’ over academic pursuit are devastating obstacles in children’s lives. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=334))
    
###### ID 234483132
> Instead of wallowing in victimhood, we can take charge of our lives and climb out of the quicksand that battles so hard and so tenaciously to pull us down. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=339))
    
###### ID 234483133
> ‘We all want progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.’ ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=358))
    
###### ID 234483134
> There are some staff rooms where you’ll often find battle-weary souls, bravely enduring their lot, the atmosphere heavy with frustration at the various struggles that burden a teacher’s life. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08B1T3K8S&location=419))
    
###### ID 234483135
> For, if the culture of our schools affects the character of our pupils, and the character of our pupils then eventually shapes the culture of our society, undoubtedly what we teach our pupils does make a genuine difference to the world around us.
