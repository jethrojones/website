## Highlights

> The Church of Jesus Christ has weighed the varying interests and has properly determined to address in classes and conferences the primacy of the interests of the newly converted. It is to these Saints the Church must give its first concerns. As to those who seek for more, they are properly left in large measure to their own study.

> Divine revelation will never come through the scholar’s tools. Instead, it comes as people follow the Gospel principles. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IEAE6E&location=288))

> When you train a young baseball player to hit baseballs, you do not start correcting at once his hands, shoulders, wrists, elbows, foot position, stride, upper body loading, torque at the mid-body, counter-rotation, release, contact, and follow through in one lesson. If you do, you are neither a good instructor nor will the batter develop any skill. There is too much going on for anything to actually improve. You teach complicated or intricate skills one step at a time. There should be in the mind of the student only one thing to do. There is always only one thing to do. There is never more than the single thing to be addressed. It is the thing most wrong at the moment. Once that is addressed and corrected, then you can move on to the next thing, where again there is only one thing to do—and it is the next thing in the sequence. When the next skill is acquired, then there is still only one thing to do. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IEAE6E&location=426))
    - Note: always focus on one thing at a time.

> The scriptures are accounts written about and by people who have received the Second Comforter. They did something to qualify. They tell us what to do. If, therefore, we want to get there, we should be eager to look carefully at what they tell us about how they got there. It is futile to travel other paths and hope to obtain the same things the authors of scriptures obtained while going in another direction—especially when the authors repeatedly tell us there is only one way.

> The Gospel is not anti-intellectual, but it requires learning through a different method than that used by academics. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004IEAE6E&location=623))
