> that first step is learning to hear and then to obey the voice of revelation in one’s soul. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=75))

###### ID 234482550
> Third, the light of Christ emanates from our Savior, is administered by the Holy Ghost, and is revelation which constitutes the conscience of man. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=105))

> every other written source of truth similarly fail the test. They simply do not guide all of the people who love and use them to the promised blessings. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=227))
    
###### ID 234482552
> There could not be a true church without a living prophet’s divinely inspired guidance. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=232))
    
###### ID 234482553
> Personal revelation (among other things) is the divine witness whereby we are able to recognize the scriptures or the words of the latter-day prophets as the “word of God.” ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=232))
    
###### ID 234482554
> Without the inspiration of personal revelation, we would not have a testimony of any form of the “word of God” (Moroni 10:5). ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=234))
    
###### ID 234482555
> Any person who grasps hold of personal revelation as his or her rod of iron, never letting go, obeying every prompting, will walk unerringly through the mists of satanic darkness and arrive at and dine upon the fruits of the tree of life. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=258))
    
###### ID 234482556
> We know personal revelation is essential to our exaltation, and all true seekers struggle to receive it. At times, however, it seems as if the heavens are made of stone, and the silence is deafening. We struggle with prayer and satisfy ourselves that the silence means “no,” when in reality it means we have not learned to receive answers to our prayers. We wade through life’s trials seemingly alone, desperately needing divine guidance and, failing to pierce the heavens, we content ourselves by assuming that only the prophets do it differently. We puzzle out our problems in our minds, arrive at a conclusion, and pray for confirmation. When we hear nothing, we take it for divine indifference and permission to proceed with our plans. We pride ourselves on having received guidance, when in fact we have not and are only groping in the darkness, pursuing our own agenda instead of the Lord’s. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=264))
    
###### ID 234482557
> Personal revelation begins as our conscience, and if we learn to give heed to it, it expands greatly after the gift of the Holy Ghost is given. It is neither reserved for the perfected nor is it only for times of great crisis. Revelation is, however, very demanding. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=274))
    
###### ID 234482558
> Recall that the path is bordered and literally defined by the rod of iron, which represents personal revelation. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=284))
    
###### ID 234482559
> the straight and narrow path represents the course of life each individual must walk in order to arrive at the tree and partake of the precious fruit. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=286))
    
###### ID 234482560
> The mists of darkness are more than isolated temptations. They are complex, intelligently organized, maliciously constructed barrages of opposition, which are impossible to penetrate with the understanding of man. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=294))
    
###### ID 234482561
> Since the rod of iron represents the light of personal revelation, it becomes obvious that the purpose of the mists of darkness is to obscure personal revelation, and thus entice us into wandering off the path. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=302))
    
###### ID 234482562
> The building was filled with the rich and powerful people of the world. It represented the vain imaginings and pride of worldly success. Throngs of people were pressing forward, struggling to enter the building. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=306))
    
###### ID 234482563
> The river of filthy water represented the depths of hell, which was the awful reward of those who chose to abandon the path once they had started upon it. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=310))
    
###### ID 234482564
> Notice, it was in close proximity to the path, meaning those most likely to fall in and be lost were those upon the path. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=311))
    
###### ID 234482565
> Every prompting which we receive to do good, to turn away from evil, and to be Christlike in our acts, comes to us through the light of Christ. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=314))
    
###### ID 234482566
> It can only be extinguished by repeated abuse, but it can be extinguished. Most important of all, it is revelation. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=324))
    
###### ID 234482567
> The operation of the Holy Spirit should not be confused with that of the Holy Ghost. When the Holy Ghost speaks in His role as a revelator, the message is much easier to understand. The Holy Ghost communicates in a more powerful way, which enlightens the soul with poignant truth. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JIWJPL6&location=346))
