> What are the possible reasons I am noticing this symptom? What isn’t happening that, if it did happen, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to either narrow or disappear? What is happening that, if it stopped happening, would cause the perceived gap (symptoms) to narrow or disappear?

###### ID 38689685
> One of my most frequent Thinking Time questions is: “What Don’t I See?” I like it so much that it is on prominent display in my office, including as a screen saver on my computer. This question is powerful because what I don’t see is what costs me money. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NXPL4L&location=306))

> What is the upside? We are usually experts at this one. What is the downside? What could go wrong? We rarely can do this one by ourselves because we are irrationally emotional and optimistic about the thing we are deciding about. Can I live with the downside? Only the pros bother to think about this one, which is why their track record of dumb tax is so much smaller than the track record of the rest of us mortals.

###### ID 38689689

###### ID 38689690
> The problem is, the vast majority of these financial self-help gurus who promise millionaire, even billionaire, status owe their financial success to selling the Kool-Aid, not from drinking it themselves. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NXPL4L&location=470))

> Culture is about accountability, measuring, a bias for urgency, a focus on solutions, calling it tight—saying what needs to be said—being kind and generous, acknowledging one another, and expressing appreciation. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NXPL4L&location=647))
    
###### ID 38689696
> The problem is that the culture we currently have in our workplace relationships is rarely a culture we consciously created. Rather, the culture in our businesses is a culture we have tolerated because of a lack of courage to address the problems of back-biting, smack, cliques, excuses, blaming, silence, gossip, procrastination, missed deadlines, being late (and unprepared) for meetings, mediocrity, and doing just enough to get by. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NXPL4L&location=653))
    
###### ID 38689697

([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NXPL4L&location=663))

> If you can commit to and live with the following principles, then you are the type of person who will be successful and help our company thrive.

###### ID 38689699
> The reason we hesitate to have the hard conversations is because we don’t care enough. If you truly cared enough, you would say what needs to be said. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NXPL4L&location=703))
    
###### ID 38689700

> Create the Culture: How people talk to each other and treat one another is the essence of culture—not how many jelly beans are in the kitchen or whether you can bring your dog to work. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NXPL4L&location=839))
