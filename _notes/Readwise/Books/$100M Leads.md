> Advertising, the process of making known, lets strangers know about the stuff you sell. If more people know about the stuff you sell, then you sell more stuff. If you sell more stuff, then you make more money. Having lots of leads makes it hard to be poor.   Advertising lets you have a terrible product... and still make money.

###### ID 619136759
> We start by picking a problem that’s narrow and meaningful. Then, solve it. And, like we just learned, when we solve one problem, a new problem reveals itself. Here comes the important part- if we can solve that new problem with our core offer, we’ve got a winner. This is because we solve this new problem in exchange for money. That’s it. Don’t overthink it. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CFDR3TYV&location=785))
    
###### ID 619136760

###### ID 619136762
> You give away free finance courses, guides, calculators, templates, etc. They are so valuable people really can do it all themselves. But, they also reveal the time, effort, and sacrifice of doing it all. So you offer financial services to solve all that. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CFDR3TYV&location=844))

> With three different types of lead magnets and four ways to deliver them, that's up to twelve lead magnets that solve a single narrow problem. So many magnets, so little time! ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CFDR3TYV&location=876))
    
###### ID 619136766

###### ID 619136769
> Action Step: Package your lead magnet in every way you can. It dramatically increases how many engaged leads come your way. And more leads engaging with your lead magnet means more leads getting value from it. This is huge. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CFDR3TYV&location=980))
    
###### ID 619136770
> Give Away The Secrets, Sell The Implementation   The marketplace judges everything you have to offer - free or not. And you can never provide too much value. But, you can provide too little. So you want your lead magnet to provide so much value people feel obligated to pay you. The goal is to provide more value than the cost of your core offer before they’ve bought it.

###### ID 619136772
> Action Step: 99% of people aren’t gonna buy, but they will create (or destroy) your reputation based on the value of your free stuff.  So, make your lead magnets as good as your paid stuff. Your reputation depends on it. Provide value. Stack the deck. Reap the rewards. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CFDR3TYV&location=1008))

###### ID 619136774
> Action Step: Give a clear, simple, action-oriented CTA. Then, give them a ‘reason why’ using scarcity, urgency, and any other reasons you can think of. And, do it often. Don't be clever, be clear. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CFDR3TYV&location=1078))
