> Sometimes people never even ask my name, like it’s not important or something. It is. My name is Melody. ([Location 54](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=54))

> Even though he sometimes made up his own vocabulary, Dad never spoke baby talk to me like my mother did. He always spoke to me as if he were talking to a grown-up, using real words and assuming I would understand him. He was right. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=116))

> “Can you stack these in order according to size?” he said loudly and slowly, as if I were hard of hearing and really stupid. But who was being stupid? Didn’t he know I couldn’t grab the blocks? Of course I knew which block was bigger than the other. But I couldn’t stack them if he paid me money! So I just took my arm and swept them all to the floor. They fell with a wooden clatter. I tried not to laugh as he picked them up. He breathed really hard as he reached for them. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=184))

> I knew the words and melodies of hundreds of songs—a symphony exploding inside my head with no one to hear it but me. But he never asked me about music. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=207))
    
###### ID 234482417
> “I know the name of her condition, Doctor,” my mother said with ice in her voice. “But a person is so much more than the name of a diagnosis on a chart!” ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=221))
    
###### ID 234482418
> In second and third grades I probably learned more from the Sci Fi or Discovery Channels than I ever learned at ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=270))
    
###### ID 234482419
> It’s like I live in a cage with no door and no key. And I have no way to tell someone how to get me out. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=357))
    
###### ID 234482420
> When I wake up in the morning, it’s always sort of a letdown as reality hits me. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=464))
    
###### ID 234482421
> I screamed because I hated stuff that was just plain stupid. I screeched because I couldn’t talk and tell her to shut up! ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=491))
    
###### ID 234482422
> I’m sure Butterscotch would have preferred a nice thick bone instead, but she can’t talk either, so both my dog and I get what they give us. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=623))
    
###### ID 234482423
> I knew that a new baby was really time-consuming. And I also knew I took up a lot of time. How would my parents ever have time for both of us? Then a really horrible thought popped into my brain. What if they decided to look into Dr. Hugely’s suggestions? I couldn’t make the thought go away. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=649))

> For me, it’s all about the freedom. Now I don’t have to wait for somebody to move me across the room. I can just go there. Nice. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ATPRNI&location=813))

> She and Mom chat a bit before a man wearing jeans and a Cincinnati Bengals sweatshirt approaches us.“Excuse me,” he says to me, “but are you Melody Brooks?” Surprised, I quickly hit “Yes.” “My name is Paul, and I’m the stage manager.” His huge hand swallows mine as he shakes it. “I’m glad you’re here early. Let’s see if we have you set up correctly. We’re really glad to have you participate.” He spoke directly to me, not Mom or Catherine! I like him right away.
