> one of the main benefits is that credit spreads also work well in sideways markets. As the markets move sideways most of the time, these strategies will help you take advantage of them. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=126))
    
###### ID 440939005
> If you’ve traded options before, you probably remember the first time you bought them. We emphasize the word “bought” because this is the typical way in which novice investors use options. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=142))
    
###### ID 440939006
> Most credit spread trades run for around 30 days. This means you can enter two or three trades over a week and have them run for a month. You won’t be adding to these positions or subtracting from them in the interim. Most of them will close themselves out at expiry by expiring worthless, so there’s no trade you need to place. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=206))
    
###### ID 440939007
> With credit spreads, selling options allows you to earn income, whether you own the underlying shares or not. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=221))
    
###### ID 440939008
> You’ll know your maximum risk and maximum reward before you enter the trade. Because of this, almost all brokers will allow you to sell credit spreads without needing any extra permissions on your account. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=231))
    
###### ID 440939009
> we’re looking at net credit spreads. These are trades which will put money into your account as soon as you enter the trade. Net debit trades on the other hand cost you money to enter, much like a directional trade does. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=264))
    
###### ID 440939010
> Horizontal spreads (also called calendar spreads) are actually just a few trade setups, while vertical spreads have many setups within them. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=273))
    
###### ID 440939011
> A horizontal spread is constructed by buying or selling a near month option and also buying or selling a far month option of the same strike price. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=275))
    
###### ID 440939012
> The idea is to assume the opposite direction in either leg. For example, if the near month option is sold, the far month is bought and vice versa. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=276))
    
###### ID 440939013
> A vertical spread on the other hand, is where you buy and sell options with different strike prices that expire on the same date. They are called vertical spreads because of the way option prices are displayed. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=278))
    
###### ID 440939014
> bull put spread. The setup is vertical because all the options bought and sold expire in the same month. This trade setup has two legs: One short ITM put One long OTM put ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=283))
    
###### ID 440939015
> Maximum profit = Premium earned from short put - Premium paid for long put = (8 – 2) = $6 per share ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=310))
    
###### ID 440939016
> Loss = Stock sale price - Short put strike price + (Premium received for short put - Premium paid for long put) = (280 - 290 + 6) = -$4 ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=316))
    
###### ID 440939017
> the maximum profit is fixed and will be earned as long as the short put finishes OTM at expiry. This makes sense because the bull put spread is a strategy we employ when we are generally bullish on the stock's prospects. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=323))
    
###### ID 440939018
> Bear Call Spread This is a bearish spread that looks to capture slightly bearish or range-bound movements in the underlying. Like the bull put spread, this setup has two legs to it: One long OTM call One short ITM call ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=326))
    
###### ID 440939019
> The first is if the underlying closes above the OTM call. In this situation, both calls will be ITM, and your maximum loss is realized. You’ll have to sell the underlying at the lower strike price, but you can buy it at the higher strike, thereby capping your loss. If the underlying finishes between the range within the two calls, your loss is equal to the price of the short call minus the underlying price. Your long call will expire worthless. The third scenario is if the underlying finishes below the short call and both options expire worthless. In this scenario, you’ll keep the maximum profit, which is the net credit you receive on entry. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=330))
    
###### ID 440939020
> Risk/Reward Another feature of these two setups is that the maximum loss is far greater than the maximum profit. In both scenarios, our maximum loss is $14, while our maximum profit is $6. This gives us a risk/reward ratio of 42%. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=351))
    
###### ID 440939021
> Let’s say we have 10 trades with a risk/reward ratio of 30%, and we win eight out of 10 trades, with a max profit per trade of $100 and a max loss of $300. Assuming we either capture the maximum profit or suffer a maximum loss on our trades, our overall profit would be: Trade 1: Win +$100 Trade 2: Win +$100 Trade 3: Win +$100 Trade 4: Loss -$300 Trade 5: Win +$100 Trade 6: Loss -$300 Trade 6: Win +$100 Trade 7: Win + $100 Trade 8: Win +$100 Trade 9: Win +$100 Trade 10: Win +$100 So our net profit after 10 trades is ($800 - $600) = $200.

> Short Iron Butterfly Spread ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=366))
    
###### ID 440939023
> There are four legs to an Iron Butterfly trade: 1 long OTM call 1 short ATM call 1 short ATM put 1 long OTM put The key feature of the Iron Butterfly is that the short call and short put have the same strike price. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=374))
    
###### ID 440939024
> Let’s look at an example to see how this works. Currently, Visa (NYSE:V) is trading at $200.99. We’ll set up our Iron Butterfly as follows: Buy one $190 put for $1.98 Sell one $200 put for $5.40 Sell one $200 call for $6.10 Buy one $210 call for $2.34 ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=383))
    
###### ID 440939025
> The maximum loss this trade will realize is the difference in the strike prices between the long and short options legs, minus the premium received on entry. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=388))
    
###### ID 440939026
> constructing the trade, the distance between the long and short legs of the trade needs to be equidistant in both spreads. The distance between the long and short call should be the same as the distance between the long and shot put. In this case, this distance equals $10. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=389))
    
###### ID 440939027
> Upper break even limit = Strike price of short put + net credit received = $200 + $7.18 = $207.18 Similarly, the lower break even limit = Strike price of short call - net credit received = $200 - $7.18 = $192.82. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=394))
    
###### ID 440939028
> The maximum profit, which is the net credit realized on entry, is realized if the stock finishes at exactly $200 at expiry. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=399))
    
###### ID 440939029
> A more realistic scenario is that the price will finish somewhere close to it and we’ll net a profit that is slightly lower than our maximum profit. The maximum loss is realized if the stock finishes outside the strike prices of the long call or put. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=400))

> Managing your options trades is simple when you do so from a rule-based perspective. We’ll give you all the rules you need to consider before changing the structure of your trade. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=413))
    
###### ID 440939031
> when constructing a bear call spread with the underlying at $280, you can buy an OTM call at $300 but write a call slightly OTM at $285. In this situation, the stock needs to move by at least $5 to push you into a loss. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=430))
    
###### ID 440939032
> The stock currently trades around $55. If we buy a $50 call for $6.50, then we have $5 of intrinsic value (because the stock is worth $5 more than the option we bought), and $1.50 of extrinsic value (the price of the option minus the intrinsic value.) ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=439))
    
###### ID 440939033
> Delta (Δ) measures the rate of change of an option’s price relative to a price movement in the underlying. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=566))
    
###### ID 440939034
> Delta values always range from -1 to 1 (although they are sometimes expressed as a percentage on broker platforms). Technically speaking, they range from -1 to 0 for put options and from 0 to 1 for calls. Put deltas are negative because they gain in value as the price of a stock falls. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=571))
    
###### ID 440939035
> The first thing to note is that the delta value is specific to the option, not to the underlying. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=575))
    
###### ID 440939036
> Since they’re so closely tied to IV, the value of an option’s delta also approximates the probability that it will finish ITM at expiry. This means an option with a delta of 0.4 has a 40% chance of finishing ITM. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=589))
    
###### ID 440939037
> Gamma measures the rate of change in an option’s delta. Instead of measuring anything to do with the underlying price, it measures the rate at which delta changes. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=602))
    
###### ID 440939038
> Given that delta is a good measure of how likely an option is to finish in the money, it’s a good idea to look at values that are as accurate as possible for ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=664))

###### ID 440939040
> If you find a broker that is great but charges assignment fees, you can trade cash-settled index options with them and avoid the fee completely. Take note that cash-settled options exist on a number of instruments other than just indexes. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=1055))
    
###### ID 440939041
> There are other notable ETFs that offer great trading opportunities. IWM is the most liquid ETF, which tracks the Russell 2000 Index while QQQ tracks the NASDAQ 100 index. XLV is a popular ETF to trade if you’re looking to take advantage of movements in the healthcare sector. XMB (materials), XLF (financials), XLE (energy) and VWO (emerging markets) are other popular options. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08NZYCXRM&location=1072))

> When we highlighted the strategies in detail in an earlier chapter, we first mentioned that the short option legs will begin ITM and finish OTM. This kind of a trade setup will bring in huge premiums since ITM options will be priced higher than OTM ones.
