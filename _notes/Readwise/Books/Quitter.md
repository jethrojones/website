###### ID 38689981
> “You can’t use analytics to figure out the message.” In other words, you can’t allow your results or the measurement of your progress to control your dream. What you do, the message, so to speak, has to be true and honest and come from the core of what you care about, not be a whim in the whirling winds of analytics.

> Measure the things you can control before the things can’t. You can measure the number of days you got up early to work on your dream. You can measure the number of emails you responded to on your website. You can measure the number of dream jobs you applied for. That’s what is going to matter at first. And if you set a high-hustle goal and miss it, you are rarely disappointed. You still made progress. If you miss a hit goal, you’re far more affected.

###### ID 38689984
> Before you get hit with that first wave of success, sit down with a piece of paper or a futureme.org email and define what your enough will look like. ([Location 2100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZL9TW0&location=2100))
    
###### ID 38689985
> I want us to have people who can dream alongside us, add their unique ideas and grow something that is bigger than we could ever do alone. That’s a need we’ll all express at one point: “I want to be part of something bigger than me.” ([Location 2217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZL9TW0&location=2217))
