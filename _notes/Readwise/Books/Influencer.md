> First, they are goal and measurement maniacs. They know the results they’re after, and they measure them mercilessly. Second, they know their vital behaviors. “Work hard” and “Be nice” are veritable watchwords at KIPP. Everything teachers and administrators do is designed to enable every student to develop these habits to a high art. And the third key to their success lies in their ability to routinely overdetermine their results. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=428))

> Despite their best efforts, Wiwat and his teammates failed. After two exhausting, expensive, and deadly years, Thai researchers found that they had accomplished nothing. The problem had actually grown far worse. That’s when Wiwat threw out the handbook. Rather than accepting the word of people who had never actually succeeded in eliminating the rapid transmission of the disease, Dr. Wiwat decided to conduct a more intensive search for a strategy.

###### ID 38689660
> Wiwat’s and Silbert’s work provides us with a classic example of the Pareto Principle, the old 80-20 Rule. This rule suggests that for whatever your change topic may be, 80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of your efforts. This means that even for the most complicated problems, ones that are influenced by, say, 10 different behaviors, influencers should focus their efforts on the top 2—and only the top 2. If they spend time on the top 4 or 5 behaviors, or, worse still, on all 10 behaviors, they’ll spread themselves too thin.

> These researchers discovered that staying happily married isn’t about 50 things. Rather, they found that it primarily comes down to how people behave during the few minutes a day or week when they disagree. If a couple’s disagreements include significant amounts of four behaviors (blaming, escalation, invalidation, or withdrawal), then their future is bleak. If, on the other hand, they learn to take time out and communicate respectfully during these few minutes, then their entire future will be far brighter. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=642))

> Notice the obvious. Recognize behaviors that are obvious (or at least obvious to experts) but underused. • Look for crucial moments. Find times when behavior puts success at risk. • Learn from positive deviants. Distinguish behaviors that set apart positive deviants— those who live in the same world but somehow produce much better results. • Spot culture busters. Find behaviors that reverse stubborn cultural norms and taboos. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=663))

> One of the vital behaviors Dr. Reid has unearthed concerns the use of praise versus the use of punishment. (For some, this appears to be a no-brainer.) The best teachers reward positive performance far more frequently than their counterparts. A second vital behavior is that teachers rapidly alternate between teaching and testing. Then, when required, they make immediate corrections. Poor performers drone on for a long time and then let students struggle, often allowing them to repeat errors. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=843))
    
###### ID 38689664
> Master influencers know that it takes only a few behaviors to create big changes in the results they care about. To do so, they look vigilantly for one or two actions that create a cascade of change. They move through this phase by using a combination of four search techniques. They look for obvious but often underutilized actions. They then seek confirmation of what seems obvious to them by examining the advice of experts. When tailoring their own change program and trying to see what will work for them (given their unique circumstance), they look not at the 98 percent of the time they’re successful but the 2 percent of the time when they fail. They then use these crucial moments to inform the actions that need to follow. Often successful influencers surface these high-leverage actions by studying individuals within their organization or circumstances who face similar problems and yet have found a way to succeed. Finally, they watch for behaviors that might be needed to break free of a culture that sustains past problems. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=862))

###### ID 38689666
> Virtually all forces that have an impact on human behavior work on only two basic drivers of behavior. Not thousands. Just two. At the end of the day a person asks, “Can I do what’s required?” and, “Will it be worth it?” The first question simply asks, “Am I able?” The second, “Am I motivated?” ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=903))
    
###### ID 38689667
> For these simpler influence challenges, feel free to use ideas “a la carte” and see how they work. You don’t always have to use all six sources of influence to create change. However, when simpler efforts fail, use the full model to diagnose the reason and to figure out how to supplement your effort to achieve greater success.

> Actually, people do learn ways to take pleasure from almost any activity, even if the activity isn’t inherently satisfying. Psychiatrist M. Scott Peck makes this point rather bluntly: “Just because a desire or behavior is natural, does not mean it is … unchangeable.… It is also natural… to never brush our teeth. Yet we teach ourselves to do the unnatural. Another characteristic of human nature—perhaps the one that makes us more human—is our capacity to do the unnatural, to transcend and hence transform our own nature.

###### ID 38689670
> Some call this insanity—applying the same tactic and expecting a new result—but a kinder explanation would be that we’re desperate. We want to convince others to change, but we have only one set of strategies—nag, guilt, and threaten. And since they’re all we have, we use them over and over. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=1094))
    
###### ID 38689671
> With the new question, Miller discovered that the best way to help individuals align their behavior with their deepest motives was to stop trying to control their thoughts and behaviors. You must replace judgment with empathy, and lectures with questions. If you do so, you gain influence. The instant you stop trying to impose your agenda on others, you eliminate the fight for control. You end unnecessary battles over whose view of the world is correct.

> That learning which thou gettest by thy own observation and experience, is far beyond that which thou gettest by precept; as the knowledge of a traveler exceeds that which is got by reading. —Thomas à Kempis ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=1158))
    
###### ID 38689673
> Dr. Csikszentmihalyi has discovered that almost any activity can be made engaging if it involves reasonably challenging goals and clear, frequent feedback. These are the elements that turn a chore into something that feels more like a game. And we all like games. ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BPO7710&location=1411))

###### ID 38689675
> We often don’t act in our long-term best interest because the short-term actions we currently enjoy are far more motivating than the remote and distant likelihood of suffering in the future. With persistent influence challenges, bad actions are generally real, fun, and now, whereas negative consequences are often fuzzy, maybe not so bad after all, and most certainly a long time off. To turn this around, influencers learn to help others love what they currently hate by allowing them choices, creating direct experiences, telling meaningful stories, and turning the tedious into a game.
