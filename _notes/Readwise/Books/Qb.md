> At first LaVell showed no interest. Then Ted Simmons, my former bishop from Scarsdale, got into the act. He and Edwards had attended Utah State University together and were old fraternity brothers. Simmons called Edwards and told him that he had to check out the quarterback from Greenwich High. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FLEGJU4&location=600))

> Anxiety for people who don’t have anxiety is simply fear. But fear is much more complex for people who live with anxiety. For starters, anxiety is genetic. I didn’t learn that until much, much later in life. Anxiety comes from deep within your body, and when it flows out it’s almost impossible to control on your own. I was a nineteen-year-old college student who didn’t understand how anxiety worked. All I knew was that I couldn’t gain control of my worries. And nothing worried me more than disappointing people. The thought of letting our fans down overwhelmed me leading up to game day. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FLEGJU4&location=1027))

> Reluctantly, I agreed to do it. But I didn’t tell anyone I was going to New York. Not even my parents, who lived forty-five minutes outside the city. I know that probably sounds strange. But whenever big things were happening to me I would always try to make them seem smaller so I could manage them better. For instance, I didn’t tell my dad when I got promoted to be McMahon’s backup. It was my way of telling myself it was no big deal. By not telling my folks that I was going to be on national television, I was telling myself: You can do this. It’s not that big of a deal. It was my way of coping. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FLEGJU4&location=1062))

> Anxiety distorts reality, creating a false sense of loneliness, but the loneliness I felt on the plane was real. I was supposed to be driving Jill home; instead I was flying home without her. It was the heaviest feeling I had experienced in my life. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FLEGJU4&location=1236))

> He said that many people are brought up to think that anxiety is a weakness. He corrected that notion. “It has nothing to do with weakness,” he told me. “It has to do with your brain and how it was developed and what you inherited from one side of your family and what you inherited from the other side of the family.” ([Location 3970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FLEGJU4&location=3970))

> This taught me a vital lesson: perception is reality. I had worked hard my entire career to establish myself as a leader. But I wasn’t a leader until I was perceived as one. ([Location 4349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FLEGJU4&location=4349))

> also learned that you become a leader in times of trouble. Leaders emerge when things don’t go well. When everyone else starts pointing fingers, a leader takes responsibility. My teammates saw me doing that on the sidelines when I got yanked from the Eagles game. The reality was that my sideline outburst was the result of lots of pent-up frustration stretching back years. It all just poured out in that moment on the sideline. I didn’t mean for it to happen. It just happened. For me it was cathartic. But for my teammates it was revelatory. They suddenly saw me in a different light. ([Location 4351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FLEGJU4&location=4351))
