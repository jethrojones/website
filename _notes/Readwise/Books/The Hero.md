> There are only two real people in fiction – the storyteller and the listener. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QSD1PV3&location=361))
    
###### ID 38689462
> The political use of the word ‘hero’ started with the dawn of mass communication and continues today. First its definition became detached from classical notions of protracted journeys and struggles, and it became a word bestowed upon anyone who did any brave and good thing – an honour always in the gift of the establishment or its mouthpieces. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QSD1PV3&location=526))
    
###### ID 38689463
> No doubt their experiences were horribly unpleasant and uncomfortable, but the automatic association of ‘soldier’ with ‘hero’ was explicitly political, as it still is, and served to short-circuit discussion, as it still does.

###### ID 38689464
> The establishment press responds to, say, a controversy about an individual soldier’s actions long ago during the Irish Troubles, by mounting a campaign that could be headlined ‘Hands Off Our Heroes’. The nudging ‘heroes’ is compounded by the ‘our’ – a smug, wheedling assumption of agreement, intended to prompt, even coerce, and equally to suggest the presence of an ‘other’ who doesn’t share ‘our’ values. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QSD1PV3&location=540))
    
###### ID 38689465
> Instead, we are invited to ‘Salute Our Heroes’, and let them board the airplane first, even though the beneficiary of our coerced cooperation is probably a warehouse clerk deployed to New Jersey. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QSD1PV3&location=545))
