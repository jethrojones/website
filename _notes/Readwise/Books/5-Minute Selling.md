> The 5-Minute Selling System consists of two planners to help you lay out your proactive calls and follow-ups for the coming week, and two trackers where you can record your progress and success. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=560))

> The more you communicate with customers and prospects, the more they buy. And the less you communicate, the less they buy. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=575))

> WEEK 1 ACTIONS Here are your minimums for your first week. These are totals for the week, which means I'm asking you for one of each action per day. 5 DYKs: That's one per day, but you can do all five in a single conversation. It takes three seconds to ask a did you know question. 5 rDYKs: That's one per day. It takes three seconds to ask a reverse did you know question. 5 quote or proposal follow-ups: That's one per day. As you'll see in Chapter 28, email is okay for quote follow-ups. This is a 20-second effort. 5 proactive calls: This is one call per day. You pick who you'd like to call, but make at least one of them a good, warm prospect. Make your call early in the morning. First thing, if possible. You will probably leave a message (one minute, maximum), but if they pick up, you'll have a friendly conversation for a few minutes. Go through the short scripts in Chapters 19–24 for what to say on these calls. If you follow them, these calls should take less than five minutes. Of course, you can decide to go longer if it's going well. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=793))

> Here's the thing. These customers who are constantly calling and sucking you into the vicious reactive circle? They're only 10–20% of all your customers. They're the ones who complain the most. They're the ones who aren't happy unless they're unhappy. They're the squeaky wheels, right? The other 80–90% of your customers? They're good! They're happy! They're not calling, because they're happy. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=872))

> how many phone calls do you make to customers and prospects when nothing is wrong, to catch up, build your relationship, and discuss what they're working on these days that you can help with? The fact is, the proactive call has gone nearly extinct. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=907))

> We don't follow up on quotes and proposals as much as we should. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=912))

> Reactive selling makes us fearful, meek, pessimistic, and cynical. These mindsets murder sales growth. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=939))
    
###### ID 440939145
> The telephone will bust you out of the reactive selling vicious circle. Proactive calls will change your life and quickly impact your sales. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=987))
    
###### ID 440939146
> In the testimonial calls—which are a part of every single project that I do with clients—we ask customers these two simple questions: What are some of your favorite things about working with us? How does that help you? ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=1001))
    
###### ID 440939147
> The proactive phone call, by definition, is a positive conversation. You will ask about the customer's family and life. You will tell the customer you were thinking about her. You will tell her it was important to you to connect. And then you will ask her what she is working on that you might be able to help her with.

> The telephone is the best communications pathway for growing sales quickly because you can make lots of calls to many customers and prospects quickly—far more than in-person visits. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084RLHWTH&location=1047))
