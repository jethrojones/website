> Safety is important, but as long as safety is the number one priority in our schools, nothing else is. I know that’s a controversial opinion, but it’s true. (Page 5)

> Where we have typically had the school system as a brace to talk about these things as a group, in person, that was largely not an option (Page 5)
    
###### ID 284829947
> Although there were the typical suggestions of punishment, bribery, and the like, the conversation ultimately went to where it needed to go: proactive responses. (Page 5)
    
###### ID 284829948
> what I will promise is that if you implement what we talk about in this book, you will approach problems like the TikTok trend in a more healthy and balanced way, with an eye for the future and a way to build culture in a positive way so that people will actually think twice before resorting to whatever is trending. (Page 6)
    
###### ID 284829949
> I want you to be proactive, not reactive. (Page 6)
    
###### ID 284829950
> It’s never too late to make a change—even if it feels like it is. (Page 6)
    
###### ID 284829951
> I’ve read dozens of educational leadership books, and so often, I walked away feeling that the amount of change was too big for me to do (Page 7)
    
###### ID 284829952
> When you have a messed-up culture in your school, your idea may be to focus on fixing the culture. This is the wrong choice. (Page 7)
    
###### ID 284829953
> Eric has learned the key to success. Clear, measurable goals that give p (Page 7)
    
###### ID 284829954
> eople clarity on what we are trying to accomplish, with flexibility in how we accomplish it. But no flexibility on the why, because there is a clear vision that is communicated regularly (Page 7)
    
###### ID 284829955
> People won’t believe that you will take care of them if they don’t believe you are taking care of yourself.” (Page 8)
    
###### ID 284829956
> 1. You can only control you. A few shortcuts to success: (Page 8)
    
###### ID 284829957
> 2. What you spend your time on is what you value. 3. Our work must always focus on the individual. (Page 8)
    
###### ID 284829958
> Big data is all fine and dandy, but no students or families care about our schoolwide data if their individual data is no good. When 95% of our students have success the remaining 5% don’t have success. They are 100% unsuccessful when we measure things that way. (Page 8)
    
###### ID 284829959
> Learning from excellence doesn’t mean copying excellence. It means that you learn from it. It took me a long time to understand the difference. (Page 9)
    
###### ID 284829960
> In your school, you may have a great culture. It’s probably somewhere in between. The lesson you need to learn is that it’s possible to have a great culture, but it’s not possible to have the same great culture. (Page 10)
    
###### ID 284829961
> As you read, ask yourself, “What I can learn from excellence?” Don’t ask yourself what you can copy. (Page 10)
    
###### ID 284829962
> She had context, and because she understood the context, she was able to implement change that made a difference. (Page 10)
    
###### ID 284829963
> as we read leadership books, that is often the takeaway: I need to implement this program or do things in this way. That piece of software is going to fix all our problems because it “worked” for that school over there. (Page 10)
    
###### ID 284829964
> The life of a caterpillar exists so that it can become the butterfly. Its whole life is gearing up for that opportunity. Wouldn’t it be crazy for the caterpillar to say, “I’m happy with where I’m at, and I don’t need to change”? Of course it would. (Page 11)
    
###### ID 284829965
> Most people say that you should take care of yourself so you have energy to take care of others. That’s a recipe for disaster! And it’s bad advice. We shouldn’t have to justify taking care of ourselves so we can take care of others. We should take care of ourselves because we are human beings, and by nature of being human, we deserve to take care of ourselves (Page 13)
    
###### ID 284829966
> Whatever you think you may accomplish at work by sacrificing yourself is not worth the toll it takes on your mind, body, and spirit. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 284829967
> You are irreplaceable, but you are very replaceable. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 284829968
> What I mean is there will never be another person like you, as referenced in the Martha Graham quote at the beginning of this chapter. At the same time, you are just a cog in a machine, and someone else can do the job in a heartbeat. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 284829969
> She would write poetry to help her, but her poetry was always dark and people didn’t like that. Especially not her teachers. You’ve seen that, I’m sure. The quiet, dark kids come across as weird and people don’t like them as much. They are ostracized. (Page 14)
    
###### ID 284829970
> stop assigning expectations and blame to what they are doing. It’s only hurtful in the end (Page 15)
    
###### ID 284829971
> Your own personal knowledge is like a garden that must be nurtured regularly. The fruits and vegetables that you grow are your choice. It doesn’t matter what you learn, apply, assess, just that you do it regularly. (Page 16)
    
###### ID 284829972
> She suggests two simple things to take care of our bodies every day, and as a bonus, they also help us get ready for tackling whatever we need to tackle each day. 1. Drink a tall glass of water in the morning. 2. Get 10 minutes of exercise. (Page 17)
    
###### ID 284829973
> You’ve got the experience, expertise, capability, and everything else you need to be successful, already within you. (Page 21)
    
###### ID 284829974
> An engine requires gas, but it is not there to serve itself. It is there to serve others. I think that we as principals are similar. Our role is to serve others. Our role is to help people day in and day out. For years. We can be that engine for our staff and our students. (Page 24)
    
###### ID 284829975
> My educational philosophy is very simple: We give people what they need when they need it. This applies to support as well. (Page 24)
    
###### ID 284829976
> if your focus is on growing leaders, then it changes how you interact with your staff and students. (Page 25)
    
###### ID 284829977
> Transformative principals are not transactional, they seek to transform others into the best version of themselves (Page 25)
    
###### ID 284829978
> Now, imagine if you have a school of people mobilizing others around what is most important. Imagine how quickly assessments, grades, and the ennui of our current iteration of school would fade quickly into the background. (Page 25)
    
###### ID 284829979
> you know, (Page 26)
    
###### ID 284829980
> Transformative principals know that delegation is more about people than it is about tasks. (Page 27)
    
###### ID 284829981
> You’ll likely believe more often than you should that you can just do it better, faster, and easier than anyone else. (Page 29)
    
###### ID 284829982
> As you are going down this path of delegation, you have to recognize that every minute anyone is working in their weakness is a waste of their time (Page 30)
    
###### ID 284829983
> You have to know your people well enough to make sure that they are living up to their potential and using their strengths as much as possible. (Page 30)
    
###### ID 284829984
> Naphtali Hoff helps us recognize that we can delegate management activities. Leadership belongs to everyone, but management can be delegated. (Page 30)
    
###### ID 284829985
> Eric, was inspired by our conversation to ask his teachers, “What would it take for me to be your hero?” This is not a question that principals would typically ask. This is a question that almost seems uncomfortable to ask (Page 31)
    
###### ID 284829986
> What do you need to do for your staff for them to say, “I love working here, and it’s a joy to go work for someone I see as my hero!”? (Page 31)
    
###### ID 284829987
> Transformative principals think longer term than their to do list. (Page 31)
    
###### ID 284829988
> I was fortunate enough to have a leader who was a hero to me when I was a young man. Because I saw him as my hero, I was willing to do things that were difficult (Page 31)
    
###### ID 284829989
> for me. I was willing to be my best even when I didn’t believe that I deserved it or was good enough. That’s what a hero brings out in you. (Page 31)
    
###### ID 284829990
> Because they delegated this responsibility to me, they gave me an area to contribute in a circumstance where I was truly the weakest link. They were my heroes for including me, when they didn’t have to. I was their hero because I could use my strengths to support them! (Page 32)
    
###### ID 284829991
> Whatever you are using, it’s a framework to help you get out of your own head and think in a different way. It’s not the be-all-and-end-all! It doesn’t define you, you define the personality test (Page 32)
    
###### ID 284829992
> Delegation is about people, not tasks. Figure out what you’re bad at, and delegate it. Figure out what you’re great at, and do that. Allow others in your building to do the same (Page 33)
    
###### ID 284829993
> Figure out who is the best person and leave the how up to them. (Page 33)
    
###### ID 284829994
> Do the work to learn the strengths of those you work with, share with them what they need to be successful, and help them in areas they are weak. (Page 33)
    
###### ID 284829995
> Transformative principals know that without a clear vision, nothing else you do will matter. Transformative principals take the time to create their Vital Vision. (Page 34)
    
###### ID 284829996
> If your purpose is to prepare kids for next year, you’ll never live up to your potential. Your purpose has to be bigger than that (Page 35)
    
###### ID 284829997
> someone (Page 36)
    
###### ID 284829998
> Everybody puts up with what they get. They like to project a future where someone is going to finally have enough and say something (Page 36)
    
###### ID 284829999
> Well, it doesn’t usually happen (Page 36)
    
###### ID 284830000
> if we are blaming our own inadequacies on some future consequence for a student, no student will ever care about what we are doing. (Page 36)
    
###### ID 284830001
> when people decide to enroll (the Seth Godin version of enroll) in your school, they will want to know if they are going to experience the same things that you want to experience. (Page 37)
    
###### ID 284830002
> If your school is just another school, you can’t have a vision that will compel people to join you, unless you want people who are just looking for a job, any job, and as soon as they find a better job, they’ll leave. (Page 39)
    
###### ID 284830003
> A leader has to have a clear vision of the school. It’s just a necessity. That’s your role as the leader: to define the vision for the school. Then get other people to help make it happen. (Page 39)
    
###### ID 284830004
> Nobody wants to be “just another school.” But that’s what you are when you have neither a clear mission statement nor a clear vision. (Page 39)
    
###### ID 284830005
> Each of these three types of values should be part of the values for our schools. Again, when everyone knows what they are, they will invite the right people to work with us and enroll in our school. When they are, people want to be there. (Page 40)
    
###### ID 284830006
> My friend Eric Makelky is fond of saying your norms are whatever behaviors you’re willing to walk by and not comment on. (Page 41)
    
###### ID 284830007
> Randy Sprick, of Safe and Civil Schools, reminded us that if doctors still need to be reminded to wash their hands, we can take a few minutes and remind school staff about appropriate social norms. (Page 41)
    
###### ID 284830008
> Transformative principals observe teachers and students often to evaluate whether the vision is being implemented. (Page 44)
    
###### ID 284830009
> Transformative principals understand that the solutions to their challenges lie with them (Page 45)
    
###### ID 284830010
> If you’re doing observations just because it is a required aspect of the evaluation, you have already lost the game. Transformative principals are more focused. (Page 45)
    
###### ID 284830011
> we as principals in the name of “instructional leadership” go into conversations with teachers all the time with a transactional approach. We act like we know what is right because we are the instructional leader, and we expect them to do as we say. (Page 46)
    
###### ID 284830012
> my goal wasn’t to get teachers to teach in a specific way, it was to help them see the potential they had for being the best teacher they could. Teachers were willing and eager to respond to my feedback, questions, insights, and suggestions when I took a transformational approach. (Page 47)
    
###### ID 284830013
> The opposite of feedback is conversations. Conversations about instruction are different from feedback about instruction (Page 47)
    
###### ID 284830014
> We need to stop giving feedback and simply start having conversations. (Page 47)
    
###### ID 284830015
> When I learned how to have a curious conversation, my teachers started reporting to me that I was actually helping them be better teachers. (Page 49)
    
###### ID 284830016
> Curiosity and self-criticism will help people know what they need to do better, faster, and more effectively than if we prescribe what they should do (Page 49)
    
###### ID 284830017
> the power of questioning is that you can ask a question and, to be honest, the response to you doesn’t matter at all. Because it’s not about you. It’s about the person you’re talking with (Page 49)
    
###### ID 284830018
> When you give someone advice, it’s like giving them a hammer. They can use that hammer and see everything as a nail, but they probably won’t. More likely, they will thank you for the hammer, show you they know how to use it, and then add it to all the other hammers in their drawer! (Page 49)
    
###### ID 284830019
> But when you ask a good, curious, well-intentioned question, it’s more like revealing a whole work of art. (Page 50)
    
###### ID 284830020
> The answer already exists, and the right question gets you to it. That may sound less scientific than we typically want to be in education, but it is the right approach. (Page 50)
    
###### ID 284830021
> in order to maintain “highly effective” status, teachers had to stop doing highly effective activities and start doing meaningless activities that benefited (Page 51)
    
###### ID 284830022
> no one except for them and only in the context of our evaluation system. (Page 51)
    
###### ID 284830023
> I wasn’t going to ask them to stop building a rocket that would take them to Mars in order to demonstrate how well they could follow directions to put together an IKEA kitchen set. (Page 51)
    
###### ID 284830024
> Our teacher observations should not be done to benefit our evaluation system. Our teacher observations should be done to match the needs of our schools and our districts, not to “align” to best practices determined from some far-off place (Page 51)
    
###### ID 284830025
> It’s much easier for the principal to then support teachers when they are struggling, because they are much more likely to ask for help if you ask them what they would change. (Page 52)
    
###### ID 284830026
> Transformative principals have empathy and systematize communication. (Page 54)
    
###### ID 284830027
> Empathy is where communication needs to start (Page 55)
    
###### ID 284830028
> We finally learned that she never saw herself as running away. She would never do that. She loves us. She wouldn’t ever want to run away from us. In each of the times she has “left without permission or notification” she has always been going to find someone or something. In her mind, she was not running away. In our mind she was. In her mind, she was going to find her dad, or her friend, or food, or was going to school. (Page 57)
    
###### ID 284830029
> Transformative principals, however, approach these difficult conversations knowing they are a necessary part of being a leader. (Page 59)
    
###### ID 284830030
> Transformative principals build positive relationships and empower their staff members to build positive relationships with all students and parents. (Page 64)
    
###### ID 284830031
> Transformative principals build positive relationships and empower their staff members to build positive relationships with all students and parents. (Page 65)

###### ID 284830033
> clicks (Page 70)
    
###### ID 284830034
> Transformative principals recognize that hiring is a year-round process that transformative principals are always engaged in. (Page 75)
    
###### ID 284830035
> which I mentioned earlier (Page 77)
    
###### ID 284830036
> that, (Page 78)
    
###### ID 284830037
> I would start today cultivating a list of email addresses of people you want to recruit to your school. Then, once a quarter I would write a letter talking about the great things that are happening at your school and send it to those people. Don’t be shy about stating the purpose of the newsletter. It’s to let people know what’s going on in your school because they might want a job there someday. (Page 78)
    
###### ID 284830038
> an, (Page 81)
    
###### ID 284830039
> I’ve heard some principals say they want to ask all the questions, and do all the interviews. Others want to delegate that to others. Again, it doesn’t matter too much. (Page 81)
    
###### ID 284830040
> Transformative principals do enough to ensure they have the right person, and they get to define how much is “enough”. (Page 81)
    
###### ID 284830041
> Sometimes, we just need a warm body to be in our school. But it is almost never worth it to hire someone just to have someone. Even though it is hard, wait until you have the right person for the job. (Page 84)
    
###### ID 284830042
> The more you focus on culture, the less it will improve. Culture is the makeup of everything else. (Page 87)
    
###### ID 284830043
> Transformative principals do all the other things that make up culture, so when it is time to focus on culture, it’s visible and present. (Page 87)
