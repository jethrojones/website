## Highlights
###### ID 343493821
> Call options, or calls as they’re known, give the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy the underlying stock at an agreed price - before a certain date. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=298))
    
###### ID 343493822
> Call options buyers make money only when the price of the underlying increases. This is irrespective of whether the underlying is a stock, bond or anything else. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=302))
    
###### ID 343493823
> Puts give you the option to sell the underlying. Just as with calls, you have the option but not the obligation to sell the underlying. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=303))
    
###### ID 343493824
> Like stocks, options have a price spread. In case you’re unfamiliar with it, the price spread identifies the buying and selling price of a particular instrument. The price at which you buy an instrument is the ask or offer price. The price at which you can sell it is the bid. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=314))
    
###### ID 343493825
> The price of an options contract is called a premium. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=318))
    
###### ID 343493826
> When you buy a put, you’re explicitly stating your opinion that the price of the stock (underlying) is going to fall. You’ll profit only if the price falls. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=322))
    
###### ID 343493827
> Briefly, the price of a contract depends on how long it has until it expires and on the current market price. Calculating this isn’t essential for your trading, so it isn’t as if you need to calculate prices all the time. It’s just good information to know. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=334))
    
###### ID 343493828
> time decay refers to the event where option premiums (prices) decrease over time. If you’re buying an options contract, then time decay means an ill-timed purchase could make capturing gains very difficult. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=374))
    
###### ID 343493829
> The longer an option has until expiration, the more valuable it is. The reasoning is that there is more time for the underlying to move into a position where the option can make you money. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=427))
    
###### ID 343493830
> Specifically, you need to understand that time value decreases as the option approaches expiry. This phenomenon is called time decay. Time decay usually accelerates once the option is less than 30 days away from expiry. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=433))
    
###### ID 343493831
> an option can make its owner money, it’s said to be in the money or ITM. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=440))
    
###### ID 343493832
> When the call option is outside the money or OTM, the strike price is greater than the market price. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=442))
    
###### ID 343493833
> Call options give you the right to buy the stock at a particular price, whereas puts give you the right to sell the underlying at a particular price. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=470))
    
###### ID 343493834
> Puts make you money when the underlying value is less than the strike price. This is when they’re ITM. Puts are OTM when the price of the underlying is higher than the strike price. For example, if Amazon is selling for $3,100, the 2,100 put is OTM, and the 3,500 put is ITM. In the case of a call, the 2,100 call will be ITM and the 3,500 call will be OTM. Always keep this in mind. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=478))
    
###### ID 343493835
> When you buy an option, you’re marrying yourself to the strike price. You need to be able to predict not just the strike price that will make you money but also the time it will take the underlying to move past that strike. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=506))
    
#### Types of Options Trading Accounts
#### TYPES OF OPTIONS TRADING ACCOUNTS
###### ID 343493837
> The first level, Level 1, allows you to implement strategies where the maximum risk is defined. In order to trade covered calls, you need a Level 1 account. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=544))
    
###### ID 343493838
> Level 2 accounts allow you to buy options. You can execute the strategies of the previous level, and you can buy puts and calls. This level’s strategies don’t require margin, but there is the possibility of loss that is undefined. This is why brokers consider these Level 2 strategies. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=551))
    
###### ID 343493839
> Level 3 and 4 accounts are reserved for complex strategies that require you to borrow on margin. Some brokers even have a Level 5 that is reserved for the riskiest strategies (from the broker’s perspective, not necessarily from an execution perspective.) ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=553))
    
###### ID 343493840
> Implied volatility or implied vol is denoted by the Greek letter sigma (Σ). It is expressed as a percentage or in terms of a standard deviation number and indicates how much the stock is likely to move in the near future. A higher implied volatility value indicates that the stock is going to be more volatile. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=571))
    
###### ID 343493841
> Beta indicates how volatile the stock has been in the past. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=576))
    
###### ID 343493842
> Options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specific price ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=584))
    
###### ID 343493843
> A call option gives you the right to buy an asset at a fixed price ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=586))
    
###### ID 343493844
> A put option gives you the right to sell an asset at a fixed price ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=587))
    
###### ID 343493845
> The price you pay for an options contract is called the premium ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=588))
    
###### ID 343493846
> You pay the premium regardless of the outcome of the contract ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=588))
    - Note: The premium is paid regardless of the outcome.
    
###### ID 343493847
> The price of the option premium is made up of two factors Intrinsic value - the difference between the price of the underlying and the how far the option is in the money If the option is out of the money, then the premium has no intrinsic value Time value (or extrinsic value) - the amount of time left in the options contract ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=589))
    
###### ID 343493848
> When you sell an options contract, you receive the premium upfront and get to keep it no matter what ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=594))
    
###### ID 343493849
> The covered call is a strategy which involves selling call options on a stock you already own ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=595))
    
###### ID 343493850
> Tesla is trading at $442.50, and the price of the 420 call option is $92. This $92 consists of $22.50 of intrinsic value, which is the difference between the price of the underlying and the strike price (442.50 – 420). The remaining $69.50 is therefore time value. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=616))
    
###### ID 343493851
> If speculation is the opposite of investing, it stands to reason that an intelligent investor stands to gain by doing the exact opposite of what the average speculator does. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=676))
    
###### ID 343493852
> The most common manner in which most speculators trade options is to use them as tools to bet on price movements. If they think the price of a stock is about to rise, they buy call options. If they think it’s about to fall, they buy puts. It’s safe to say none of these directional trades work well consistently. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=677))
    - Note: And this is how Robinhood is currently set up.
    
###### ID 343493853
> This is the core thesis behind writing covered calls: By writing options, you’re placing yourself in a position of maximum success since the odds are in your favor right from the start. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=685))
    
###### ID 343493854
> The true way to make money in the markets is to ensure that you lose very little when you do lose and win a lot when you win. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=713))
    
###### ID 343493855
> When the reasons change, you need to exit your position even if it’s continuing to rise. Traders are more concerned with the price, and this is why they exit the trade if it goes against them. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=716))
    
###### ID 343493856
> It’s great to make money. It’s easy to start thinking of yourself as the best investor ever when this happens. The key is to keep executing your strategy over and over. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=722))
    
###### ID 343493857
> Some investors sabotage themselves by demanding excitement. When everything is said and done, the covered call is a pretty boring strategy. It’s not exciting and the money you receive will start becoming monotonous, even if such a state of affairs seems unrealistic to you right now. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=724))
    
###### ID 343493859
> Most investors hold their long stock legs in an individual retirement account (IRA). We advise against writing covered calls on investments held in a retirement account. This strategy is pretty risk-free, but there is a chance of you having to sell your long stock leg. If you do this from an IRA, you’ll end up paying a 10% penalty plus taxes. Besides, the point of an IRA is to maximize your after-tax profits. Using it to generate cash flow is not advisable. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=731))
    
###### ID 343493858
> We must mention that the long stock leg is implemented using your usual investment principles. You don’t need to think of the covered call when buying the stock. The main point of the covered call is to monetize your existing investments for cash flow. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=742))
    
###### ID 360198733
> Most investors hold their long stock legs in an individual retirement account (IRA). We advise against writing covered calls on investments held in a retirement account. This strategy is relatively straightforward, but there is a chance of you having to sell your long stock leg. If you do this from an IRA and withdraw the money, you’ll end up paying a 10% penalty plus taxes. Note, that your stock being called away is not a taxable event in itself. However as the point of an IRA is to maximize your after-tax profits, using it to generate cash flow is not advisable. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=745))
    
###### ID 343493860
> The second leg of the trade is a short or written call. We previously mentioned that writing a call is perhaps the riskiest thing a market participant can do. We must clarify that statement. Writing a naked call is the riskiest thing to do. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=752))
    
###### ID 343493861
> Here are the steps you need to take to implement the covered call: Buy the stock (at least 100 shares to cover one options contract. If you plan on writing more contracts, you’ll need to buy shares in multiples of 100) Write calls. Monitor your trade. ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=770))
    
###### ID 343493862
> Choosing the strike price for your call is critical. You want to pick a price that is far enough away so as to reasonably expire OTM, but you also want it to be close enough to the underlying price so that the option premium is high. ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=786))
    
###### ID 343493863
> Time value decays as the option you’ve written enters the last 30 days of expiry, therefore you want to choose options that expire beyond this term. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=789))
    
###### ID 343493864
> The covered call should ideally be implemented when you’ve already captured unrealized gains from your stock position. This way, even if you do get assigned the stock, you’ll make money since you bought it at a lower price. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=795))
    
###### ID 343493865
> Long stock purchase price = $80 Long stock leg investment cost = $8,000 (80*100) Premium received upon writing 140 call = $59 Return on investment = (59/8,000) = 0.73% Annualized return before compounding = return on investment*12 = 8.85% New cost basis of investment = (8,000 – 59) = $7,941 New effective purchase price of your stock = (7,941/100) = $79.41 We’ve used an annualized return, because this trade plays out over a period of just 30 days. Therefore it is completely possible to repeat the same trade 12 times over the course of a year. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=806))
    
###### ID 343493866
> If it declines for years on end, then your capital losses will outweigh whatever cash flow you earn. This is why we recommend initiating covered calls on positions that already have enough of a profit cushion built into them. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=832))
    
###### ID 343493867
> The best-case scenario is for you to partake in the capital gains from your investment and keep earning steady cash flow on it using covered calls. ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=875))
    - Note: If I reduce my cost-basis does that mean that my capital gains will be higher?
    
###### ID 343493868
> the real trick to avoiding this risk is to make a mental shift and to look at covered calls as a little boost to your gains instead of being a primary driver of them. The real driver of gains is the long stock leg of the trade. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1121))
    
###### ID 343493869
> You need to prioritize holding onto the stock at all costs. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1123))
    
###### ID 343493870
> The covered call is meant for investors who already hold long positions with a decent level of capital gains built up in them already. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1130))
    
###### ID 343493871
> You should strive to write calls at levels that are unlikely to be hit, and write them at times when the market is flat rather than trending. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1140))
    
###### ID 343493872
> If you bought the stock for long-term investment purposes and if the original investment thesis is still valid, then you ought to be delighted that the stock price has declined. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1149))
    
###### ID 343493873
> So carefully evaluate your reason for entering the long stock leg. If your original investment reasoning is no longer valid, then it’s best to take the loss and move on. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1154))
    
###### ID 343493874
> If you’re not able to stop thinking about your short call’s strike price, then you're better off avoiding this strategy. Exchanging a small profit for increased anxiety is not a recipe for success. The aim is to make money safely and sleep well at night. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1163))
    
###### ID 343493875
> technical analysis aims to measure the short-term drivers of a stock’s price. Which is to say, it’s aim is to try to spot the emotional direction of the market. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1183))
    
###### ID 343493876
> Technical analysis aims to identify the direction of the underlying order flow. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1187))
    
###### ID 343493877
> Oscillators measure short-term momentum in price moves. They’re usually bound between two extremes, typically 0 and 100. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1200))
    
###### ID 343493878
> Mathematical indicators are our entry point into the voodoo territory of technical analysis. ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1205))
    
###### ID 343493879
> The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two that preceded it. ([Location 1206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1206))
    
###### ID 343493880
> Some of the most relevant Fibonacci levels are 100%, 61.8%, 50% and 33%. The idea is that once a price begins to pull back downwards from an uptrend, or upwards from a downtrend, prices always react at these levels. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1208))

#### Choppiness Index
###### ID 343493883
> The Choppiness Index is an indicator used to identify whether the price of an asset is trending in a direction or moving sideways. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1227))
    
#### Average Directional Index
###### ID 343493885
> Anytime the indicator prints a value greater than 25, a trend is on. Anything below this value indicates a range or sideways movement in the stock price. Trend traders use the ADX to determine the relative strength of a trend. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1253))
    
###### ID 343493886
> Between the choppiness index and ADX, you have all you need from a technical analysis standpoint to determine whether a market is trending or sideways. The biggest thing to remember is when you do not have a strong trending market; you have the ideal conditions for writing a covered call. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1270))
    
#### Bollinger Bands
###### ID 343493888
> Bollinger bands are a fantastic indicator because they can be used to measure the degree of volatility in a stock’s price. They’re plotted over price bars, and this removes the need for you to take a look at another window when trying to interpret them. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1272))
    
###### ID 343493889
> The idea is that a price move that is more than two standard deviations away from the average price movement is an extraordinary one. A move to such extremes will almost always result in a pullback towards the mean. This is because 2 standard deviations represent a 95% chance of prices being between the bands rather than outside them. ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1278))
    
###### ID 343493890
> SAR stands for stop and reverse, and it’s a pretty apt description of this indicator. The SAR is plotted on the price chart itself as a series of dots. When the dots are plotted above price, it’s a short indication. When they’re below price, it’s time to go long. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1300))
    
###### ID 343493891

### 9 A SIMPLE METHOD FOR SELECTING THE RIGHT STOCKS TO WRITE COVERED CALLS ON
###### ID 343493895
> You don’t want to be writing covered calls against penny stocks that can increase by 1,000% and decline by the same amount. Other stocks to avoid are hot stocks that are being discussed in the media or are present in sectors that attract many speculators. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1331))
    
###### ID 343493896
> Therefore the ideal covered call writing candidate is a boring stock that you would be thrilled to own for the long term. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1335))
    
###### ID 343493897
> When choosing covered call candidates, you want to choose companies that have a good record of profitability but not those that are expected to increase exponentially anytime soon. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1341))
    
###### ID 343493898
> You want to choose well established businesses that have simple business structures. We highlighted Coca-Cola as an example. Ford is another example. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LHJXXMB&location=1344))
    
###### ID 343493899
