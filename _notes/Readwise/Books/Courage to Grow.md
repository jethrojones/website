> Be forewarned, however, that if you’re anything like hundreds of parents and me, once you discover how much children can do in an environment that dignifies, magnifies, and inspires their minds to learn, there’s no going back to traditional classrooms again.

> “I can’t draw,” I said to my husband, Jeff. “Yes, you can,” he said. “Turn the image you are trying to draw upside down. Now draw exactly what you see. Your left brain quiets down. Its rational language and organizing directives will allow your right brain to take over, releasing you from your judging, analytical self. No longer will you feel bound by ‘it’s a chair’ and feel the stress to draw the perfect chair. Try it!” This exercise, developed in the late 1970s by Betty Edwards and written up in her book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, changed everything about my understanding of learning to draw. I discovered a new part of myself by turning the image of my subject matter upside down. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076J1C18G&location=146))

> Despite our backgrounds in education, we never set out to start our own school or design something brand new in the K–12 realm. It was only when we had children of our own that things changed. We understood the world our children would face would be vastly different—unimaginably so—from the world we encountered as young adults. We knew they’d need to be armed to know how to learn, respond, innovate, and create in their own way rather than become skilled at taking tests and following instructions like we had. We believed our children would need the light of curiosity burning brightly in their eyes—not just when they were young learners, but throughout their childhood, teen years, and far beyond.
