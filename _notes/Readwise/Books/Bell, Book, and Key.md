## Highlights

> Radio and TV spread quickly in the 20th century, but there were a limited number of outlets for programming. This meant everyone was steeped in the same culture. For several decades, nothing would mark you as an outsider faster than not knowing certain TV and movie themes or failing to recognize characters everyone else knew.

> Not to put you on the spot, because I can’t give you a full explanation, either. And when you move to something really complex like the CHRONOS technology . . . you need a scientist to explain it, right? ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=3344))
    
###### ID 270990767
> Now, consider someone with only a very rudimentary grasp of basic science concepts and think how much more difficult it might be for them. ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=3347))
    
###### ID 270990768
> People might not exactly think of their televisions or their microwave ovens as magic machines . . . but without a solid grasp of science, they come to accept their function in much the same way they believe in religious miracles or anything else they can’t explain. Magical thinking is the human default setting.” ([Location 3348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=3348))
    
###### ID 270990769
> And I’m paraphrasing, but the law is something like any very sophisticated technology is indistinguishable from magic.” ([Location 3352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=3352))
    - Note: This is how people see the covid vaccines
    
###### ID 270990770
> The Fifth Column files say there was something people referred to as the Satanic Panic during the original timeline, but this raised things to an entirely new order of magnitude. ([Location 4763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=4763))
    
###### ID 270990771
> I can’t think of any nation in history where turning inward resulted in the country becoming stronger over time. ([Location 4794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=4794))
    
###### ID 280698039
> Full isolationism, religious control over education, and—as usual in that scenario—science gets the ax. ([Location 5893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=5893))
    - Note: Religin and science cam coexist. But not wjen science is treated as a religion.
    
###### ID 280698040
> It is the voice that urges not peace through strength and manhood, but harps instead on the horror of modern warfare, urging us to accept the beauty and even the necessity of peace, with the terms of that peace always set by our enemy. ([Location 6641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=6641))
    
###### ID 280698041
> We couldn’t criminalize free speech or opposition to the war, so we tried to get the public to associate hippies and the counterculture with marijuana and LSD. ([Location 7077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08TM9PNFT&location=7077))
