> While email is a helpful technology, it can’t replace the power of face-to-face communication. Written communication is a minefield of misunderstandings. Consider the sentence, “I didn’t say you were beautiful.” You can interpret that six ways depending on which word you emphasize! Six words, six different meanings—and matters only get murkier with more complexity. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=119))
    - Note: true

> Plus, it makes financial sense when you consider the cost of running a typical hour-long meeting. If you have 10 employees who each make $70,000 a year—$35 an hour, in other words—that’s $350 for a one-hour meeting. In fact, the average meeting costs about $500 to $1,000 an hour.

> You can save a significant amount of time by having a proper agenda and allowing your people to opt in or out of meetings to which they don’t feel they can add value. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=173))
    - Note: how would this look in schools? kms committee would be a lot different if people came and went. the reality is that i see ad coumcil as one that i can easily skip.

> Next is the numbers portion of the meeting, which involves posting key metrics so that everyone is aware of where things stand—for example, sharing sales figures. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=206))
    - Note: we could focus on things like attendance or math facts or problems solved in ixl or behavior or somthing else

> CEOs think and act in terms of maximizing these resources to create value. As the CEO, you wouldn’t want to waste your people’s time in a meeting, because that loses you money and resources. This is the same mindset that the senior leader who is running the meeting needs to adopt. Preferably, I’d love to see everyone in the room, from the frontline team member to senior management, embrace this thinking, because it focuses your attention on how to create the most value. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=252))

> In fact, when I spoke less in meetings, I often heard my ideas pitched by others. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=270))
    
###### ID 38689801
> As the CEO, it’s not important to share your ideas; it’s important to drive the company in the direction you want to go. The best way to do that is to develop leaders—people who can think critically, who are comfortable sharing their ideas, and who engage in debates. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=278))

> When you’re leading or participating in a meeting, the biggest challenge is preventing the Dominants and Expressives from steamrolling the Analyticals and Amiables. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=308))
    
###### ID 38689803
> Most of the time, they need simple reassurance that they’ve been heard, their ideas captured, and their contributions understood. The great thing about these individuals is they accept that being heard doesn’t mean the leader will always take their ideas. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=311))
    
###### ID 38689804
> When people make these choices, we should cheer them for their decision to stay focused on their responsibilities and priorities instead of becoming involved in everything. They’re looking through the lens of how best to generate value for the company through their time and resources, and this is exactly what we want to encourage all our people to do. Plus, when people opt out who don’t believe they can provide value, then only those who do believe they can provide value will sit around the table to engage in a more focused discussion.

> “No agenda, no attenda” is my motto. This is mandatory. If I don’t receive an agenda, I won’t go to a meeting, and neither should you or your employees. Keep your agenda simple, short, and sweet. It should be so brief that it could be written on a Post-It Note. You don’t need reams and reams of content—people don’t have the time for it. Use normal black-and-white colors, and skip the fancy fonts. Include a bulleted list of action items to be discussed in the order they will be addressed, the time allotted for each topic, and the meeting style chosen. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=466))
    
###### ID 38689806
> On your agenda, you will also want to include two other key components: the purpose and possible outcomes. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=473))

> Parkinson’s law states, “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” With that in mind, it’s incumbent on us to find ways to compress time. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=566))
    
###### ID 38689808
> I subscribe to the rule that, if you’re on your device, I can call you out for checking email or doing something irrelevant in the meeting. If you’re guilty, then you buy the group lunch. But if I call you out and I’m wrong, then I buy everyone lunch. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=604))
    - Note: what a great way to handle this issue!
    
###### ID 38689809
> Every meeting must include five key roles: the Moderator, the Parking Lot, the Timekeeper, the Participants, and the Closer. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01E95KZ1K&location=611))
