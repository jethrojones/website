> And from what we know, he truly saw each and every one of these obstacles as an opportunity to practice some virtue: patience, courage, humility, resourcefulness, reason, justice, and creativity. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=99))

###### ID 234481364
> This philosophic approach is the driving force of self-made men and the succor to those in positions with great responsibility or great trouble. On the battlefield or in the boardroom, across oceans and many centuries, members of every group, gender, class, cause, and business have had to confront obstacles and struggle to overcome them—learning to turn those obstacles upside down. That struggle is the one constant in all of their lives. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=109))

> Objective judgment, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptance—now at this very moment—of all external events. That’s all you need. —MARCUS AURELIUS ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=226))

###### ID 234481372
> We can see disaster rationally. Or rather, like Rockefeller, we can see opportunity in every disaster, and transform that negative situation into an education, a skill set, or a fortune. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=317))
    
###### ID 234481373

###### ID 234481374
> He had made his choice: This can’t harm me—I might not have wanted it to happen, but I decide how it will affect me. No one else has the right. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=351))
    
###### ID 234481375
> In fact, if we have our wits fully about us, we can step back and remember that situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad. This is something—a judgment—that we, as human beings, bring to them with our perceptions. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=362))

###### ID 234481377
> In these situations, talent is not the most sought-after characteristic. Grace and poise are, because these two attributes precede the opportunity to deploy any other skill. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=408))
    
###### ID 234481378
> We must possess, as Voltaire once explained about the secret to the great military success of the first Duke of Marlborough, that “tranquil courage in the midst of tumult and serenity of soul in danger, which the English call a cool head.” ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=409))

###### ID 234481380
> Life is really no different. Obstacles make us emotional, but the only way we’ll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check—if we can keep steady no matter what happens, no matter how much external events may fluctuate.

> Don’t let the force of an impression when it first hit you knock you off your feet; just say to it: Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test. —EPICTETUS ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=492))
    
###### ID 234481382
> Everything about our animalistic brains tries to compress the space between impression and perception. Think, perceive, act—with milliseconds between them. A deer’s brain tells it to run because things are bad. It runs. Sometimes, right into traffic. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=509))

> Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. —VIKTOR FRANKL ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=536))
    
###### ID 234481384
> Everything changed for Clooney when he tried a new perspective. He realized that casting is an obstacle for producers, too—they need to find somebody, and they’re all hoping that the next person to walk in the room is the right somebody. Auditions were a chance to solve their problem, not his. From Clooney’s new perspective, he was that solution. He wasn’t going to be someone groveling for a shot. He was someone with something special to offer. He was the answer to their prayers, not the other way around. That was what he began projecting in his auditions—not exclusively his acting skills but that he was the man for the job. That he understood what the casting director and producers were looking for in a specific role and that he would deliver it in each and every situation, in preproduction, on camera, and during promotion.

###### ID 234481386
> In life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I find good and bad? In me, in my choices. —EPICTETUS ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=586))
    
###### ID 234481387
> And what is up to us? Our emotions Our judgments Our creativity Our attitude Our perspective Our desires Our decisions Our determination ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=626))

###### ID 234481389
> Our problem is that we’re always trying to figure out what things mean—why things are the way they are. As though the why matters. Emerson put it best: “We cannot spend the day in explanation.” Don’t waste time on false constructs. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=678))

Eisenhower made an announcement: He’d have no more of this quivering timidity from his deflated generals. “The present situation is to be regarded as opportunity for us and not disaster,” he commanded. “There will be only cheerful faces at this conference table.” ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=758))

    - Note: I do not think so
    
###### ID 234481398
> In life, it doesn’t matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters what you do with what happens and what you’ve been given. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=895))
    
###### ID 234481399
> We must all either wear out or rust out, every one of us. My choice is to wear out. —THEODORE ROOSEVELT ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=920))
    
###### ID 234481400
> The German troops had a saying about him: Where Rommel is, there is the front. That’s the next step: ramming your feet into the stirrups and really going for it. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=952))

###### ID 234481402
> It surprised even his commanding officers, who time and time again attempted to slow Rommel down. They preferred deliberation and discourse to advancement. It had a devastating effect on the momentum that Rommel had built with his troops—just as it does in our own lives.

###### ID 234481409
> It’s okay to be discouraged. It’s not okay to quit. To know you want to quit but to plant your feet and keep inching closer until you take the impenetrable fortress you’ve decided to lay siege to in your own life—that’s persistence. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1041))

###### ID 234481413
> The old way of business—where companies guess what customers want from research and then produce those products in a lab, isolated and insulated from feedback—reflects a fear of failure and is deeply fragile in relation to it. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1060))

There will be no better teacher for your career, for your book, for your new venture. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1087))
    
###### ID 234481415
> It’s time you understand that the world is telling you something with each and every failure and action. It’s feedback—giving you precise instructions on how to improve, it’s trying to wake you up from your cluelessness. It’s trying to teach you something. Listen.

###### ID 234481417
> That may seem almost too simple. But envision, a master practicing an exceedingly difficult craft and making it look effortless. There’s no strain, no struggling. So relaxed. No exertion or worry. Just one clean movement after another. That’s a result of the process. We can channel this, too. ([Location 1136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1136))
    
###### ID 234481418
> We needn’t scramble like we’re so often inclined to do when some difficult task sits in front of us. Remember the first time you saw a complicated algebra equation? It was a jumble of symbols and unknowns. But then you stopped, took a deep breath, and broke it down. You isolated the variables, solved for them, and all that was left was the answer. Do that now, for whatever obstacles you come across. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1138))
    
###### ID 234481419
> When it comes to our actions, disorder and distraction are death. The unordered mind loses track of what’s in front of it—what matters—and gets distracted by thoughts of the future. The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync. ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1142))
    
###### ID 234481420
> When we get distracted, when we start caring about something other than our own progress and efforts, the process is the helpful, if occasionally bossy, voice in our head. It is the bark of the wise, older leader who knows exactly who he is and what he’s got to do: Shut up. Go back to your stations and try to think about what we are going to do ourselves instead of worrying about what’s going on out there. You know what your job is. Stop jawing and get to work.

###### ID 234481425
> In every situation, life is asking us a question, and our actions are the answer. Our job is simply to answer well. Right action—unselfish, dedicated, masterful, creative—that is the answer to that question. That’s one way to find the meaning of life. And how to turn every obstacle into an opportunity. If you see any of this as a burden, you’re looking at it the wrong way. Because all we need to do is those three little duties—to try hard, to be honest, and to help others and ourselves. That’s all that’s been asked of us. No more and no less. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L1B8K&location=1222))

> Zemurray, the tiny, uneducated competitor, was outmatched, right? He couldn’t play their game. So he didn’t. Flexible, fluid, and defiant, he just met separately with both of the supposed owners and bought the land from each of them. He paid twice, sure, but it was over. The land was his. Forget the rule book, settle the issue. This is pragmatism embodied. Don’t worry about the “right” way, worry about the right way. This is how we get things done.

> Kierkegaard would write under pseudonyms, where each fake personality would embody a different platform or perspective—writing multiple times on the same subject from multiple angles to convey his point emotionally and dramatically.
