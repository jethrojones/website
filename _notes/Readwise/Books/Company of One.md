But the opposite is often true: not all growth is beneficial, and some growth can actually reduce your resilience and your autonomy.

###### ID 234482308
> Many large corporations have companies of one hiding within them. If the skills and passion for innovation and autonomy of these employees are fostered, it can greatly benefit the entire business as a whole. But if they are stifled in their creativeness and freethinking, they tend to move on quickly to other employment or entrepreneurialism.

###### ID 234482331
> Purpose and passion are quite different. While purpose is based on a core set of values held by a company or even a business owner and shared with customers, passion is simply a whim based on what we think we enjoy doing. The tired business advice that we should all “follow our passion” implies that we are entitled to getting paid to do work that is always enjoyable.

> The first is that they were skilled at what they did before they took a leap—so skilled that they were doing well enough that if their leap to something new faltered, they’d still be okay.

###### ID 234482336
> The second missing ingredient in their account of successfully “following their passion” is that they were able to test their leap with a smaller jump before they climbed to the top of the highest platform. Most of these speakers neglect to mention that they didn’t just willy-nilly jump; rather, they did a small jump first to make sure they could land it (that is, they made sure there was enough demand for their offerings) and not drown once they hit the water.

> Finally, to be the most helpful to your customers, you sometimes have to look beyond the problems they’re presenting to you. The underlying reason customers are asking for help is often not obvious: sometimes they’re looking for specific answers, but sometimes they’re asking for a certain feature without even being aware that’s what they’re doing. For example, when I was doing web design, clients would often want me to design a site that, in their words, would simply look great. Over time, though, I realized that wasn’t the main reason most customers wanted to hire me: what they really wanted was a site that would look great but also generate more revenue. When I changed my sales pitch and began speaking about how good design could help a potential customer achieve more profit, the number of projects I landed from sales calls more than doubled.

Instead, in Lieberman’s estimation, belonging and connection, which Maslow defines as psychological needs, are our most basic need and should be at the bottom of the pyramid, because humans are wired to connect with each other.

When Niehues was forty, he was unemployed but keenly interested in painting landscapes. So he reached out to Bill Brown, who had a monopoly on ski maps at the time, to see if he needed help. Turned out he did, and was actually about to retire. So after they did a few projects together and developed a deep connection, Brown passed all his commissions to Niehues—who has now made a living painting ski maps for thirty years.
