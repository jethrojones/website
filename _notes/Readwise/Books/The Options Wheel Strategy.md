> A more realistic number for you to target is 0.3-0.5% per week. This will give you an annualized return between 15-26%. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=239))
    
### 2 HOW THE WHEEL WORKS – STEP BY STEP
###### ID 370175385
> STEP ONE: CHOOSE A STOCK ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=257))
    
###### ID 370175386
> STEP TWO: SELLING CASH-SECURED PUTS ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=262))
    
###### ID 370175387
> writing a put means you will have to buy the stock at the strike -- $28.50 -- if the long put holder exercises the option. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=270))
    
###### ID 370175388
> Because you’re writing puts, your broker is going to limit your risk exposure and require you to have cash in hand to buy AT&T in case it finishes ITM – at or below the $28.50. This means you’ll need to have enough cash to buy 100 shares of AT&T (if ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=273))
    
###### ID 370175389
> If you like AT&T’s long term prospects, but don’t have the money to buy 100 shares, , then you must decide if you want to simply buy some shares now, or wait until you have the cash. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=278))
    
###### ID 370175390
> If you’ve done proper research into a stock, and believe it to be a good investment, you will probably do better buying as many shares as you can afford, rather than waiting. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=281))
    
###### ID 370175391
> The cash return you’ll earn from a CSP will always pale compared to the capital gains you’ll receive from a long-term investment holding. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=287))
    
###### ID 370175392
> If the CSP option finishes OTM, meaning the stock’s market price is greater than the put’s strike price, you get to keep the premium and your cash balance remains intact. You won’t have the option assigned to you. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=296))
    
###### ID 370175393
> With this strategy as with most written options, it’s frequently best to pick an expiration that is between 21-45 days away. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=298))
    
###### ID 370175394
> Unless you want to spend a lot of time monitoring the trade, we recommend that you stick to the 21-45 days. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=302))
    
###### ID 370175395
> The only risk with the CSP is that the underlying stock rises by a huge extent. This means you’ll have missed the capital gains in exchange for a small premium. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=308))
    
###### ID 370175396
> Remember that you should initiate CSPs only on stocks that you’re keen on owning. Do not make the mistake of writing CSPs on random stocks because you think they won’t finish ITM. This is a highly speculative strategy that is not an intelligent way of investing. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=316))
    
###### ID 370175397
> STEP FOUR: SELL A COVERED CALL ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=320))
    
###### ID 370175398
> The primary, money-making leg is a long stock position, and the second leg is a short call. CCs can be used for both long-term investment as well as short-term income. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=321))
    
###### ID 370175399
> Of course, that doesn’t mean it needs to skyrocket immediately. In fact those kinds of stocks are not ideal covered call candidates . Instead we are looking for stocks with an overall mildly bullish trend to them. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=324))
    
###### ID 370175400
> The best way to figure out where you ought to place your strike is to explore the options calculator on your broker’s software. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=362))
    
###### ID 370175401
> if you’ll be paying assignment fees, check to see how much they’ll reduce your profit. You might be better off writing calls that are well OTM, thereby avoiding assignment and fees. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=371))
    
###### ID 370175402
> With every passing day, an option loses value, a concept called time decay, and that decay accelerates as the expiration date gets nearer. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=380))
    
###### ID 370175403
> You don’t want to lose long-term price appreciation in exchange for an option premium. The premium will amount to just a few percentage points while the unrealized gains on the stock can be much higher. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=385))
    
###### ID 370175404
> Long-term investors will benefit from pushing their calls OTM but not their puts. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=405))
    
###### ID 370175405
> Usually, investors implement covered calls to generate income, but if you have the cash to buy a stock and then sell a covered call, it makes sense to first put it to use with a CSP. You’ll double the income you earn from your trade. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=412))
    
### 3 CHOOSING A BROKER
###### ID 370175406
> Commissions and fees are a considerable headwind to overcome when it comes to trading. With options, there are government fees that are the same across all brokers, and then there are two tiers of commissions/fees that will vary from broker to broker. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=419))
    
###### ID 370175407
> the contract fees on Tastyworks are capped at $10 regardless of the trade size. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=426))
    
###### ID 370175408
> Take the time to consider your trading volume and look at the commissions and fees schedule that the broker advertises. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=427))
    
###### ID 370175409
> The best brokers to pick are the ones who cater exclusively to active traders. These companies have the most sophisticated tools. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=436))
    
###### ID 370175410
> Avoid choosing brokers who cater to long-term investors. A tell-tale sign is a lack of services and platform features. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=439))
    
###### ID 370175411
> If you are not ready to change brokers, then you can use a resource such as tradingview.com or stockcharts.com. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=446))
    
###### ID 370175412
> One type of options trade that can be very profitable is the credit spread, where you enter 2 option legs at once. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=450))
    
###### ID 370175413
> Writing covered calls can typically be done with a Level 1 account. For cash secured puts though, many brokers require Level 2 account status. As you gain more knowledge about trading options, you will need to obtain a Level 3 or 4 approval to trade more sophisticated strategies. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=471))
    
###### ID 370175414
> Tastyworks by Tastytrade $1 per contract to open (capped at $10 per trade) Cheaper fees for trading index options Zero commissions to close Can open/close both legs of the trade simultaneously Easy to set up take automatic profit targets Free ACH deposits & withdrawals Excellent education platform ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=492))
    
###### ID 370175415
> Thinkorswim by TD Ameritrade Commission free trading for US stocks & options $0.65 per contract No assignment fees Easy to use software ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=495))
    
###### ID 370175416
> “CAN I USE ROBINHOOD OR WEBULL FOR THIS?” We get this question from email subscribers quite a lot, as many of them are using Robinhood or WeBull to buy stocks. The answer is… yes, but we don’t recommend it. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=496))
    
### 4 CHOOSING THE RIGHT CANDIDATES
###### ID 370175418
> The Wheel is an income-generation strategy, but don’t forget that price appreciation of the long stock will bring you the greatest gains over the long term. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=514))
    
###### ID 370175419
> When starting out, focus on your stock selection criteria more than anything else. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=516))
    
###### ID 370175420
> For The Wheel to work well you need to look for stocks that are either moving sideways in a range or slightly upwards. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=520))
    
###### ID 370175421
> The ADX, for example, can help. This one is a trend strength indicator that fluctuates between 0 and 100, but it rarely hits those maximum values. Any number greater than 30 indicates a good trend, with numbers greater than 40 indicating a strong trend. Numbers below 30 indicate the absence of a trend. Good charting software will help you identify a stock’s ADX value. For The Wheel, you want to look for ADX numbers from 0 to 40, but if you’re conservative, you can stick to values less than 30. Note that the ADX doesn’t inform us about the direction of the trend, merely its strength. You’ll need to look at the chart to figure out which way the stock is headed. A strong bearish trend will print the same numbers on the ADX as a strong bullish trend does. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=534))
    
###### ID 370175422
> If the stock isn’t being heavily traded, its options will suffer from even lower volumes. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=548))
    
###### ID 370175423
> Typically you buy on the ask and sell on the bid. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=551))
    
###### ID 370175424
> It’s therefore best to stay far away from sub-$5 stocks. If you don’t have the capital to trade stocks that are priced greater than this, then spend time acquiring enough capital to be able to do so. A lack of capital shouldn’t push you towards trading unreliable stocks. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=557))
    
###### ID 370175425
> So how much capital do you need? With $2,000 you can trade one option of a stock that’s priced at $20, with $5,000 you can trade an ETF priced at $50, and with $10,000 you can trade an ETF or a stock priced at $100. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=559))
    
###### ID 370175426
> Bank of America, FLIR Systems, Coca-Cola, AT&T, Intel and First Solar are examples of stocks that were good for people with smaller accounts in the past 2-3 years. With ETFs XLK (technology) and XLF (financials) were good candidates. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=561))
    
###### ID 370175427
> The options that were written in this test had an average expiration range of 45 days. This meant the strategy captured time decay in its entirety. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=595))
    
###### ID 370175428
> One way to mitigate this temptation is to apply a 1% dividend yield filter when screening for potential stocks. This will remove all growth stocks from your final list. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=620))

###### ID 370175436
> Price Next, we fix our price criteria. Let’s focus on $10 per share. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=711))
    
###### ID 370175437
> Volume Next, you should stick to stocks and ETFs that are heavily traded. Choose an average daily volume of at least 200,000 shares - with the last session’s (“Current volume”) equal to or greater than this number. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=713))
    
###### ID 370175438
> Stability Filtering out growth stocks is important. Add a filter for a one-percent dividend yield and you’ll get rid of high-growth stocks. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=716))

###### ID 370175440
> No Upcoming Events One of the most important filters you should include is requiring that there are no earnings announcements coming up over the next 30 days. For the Earnings Date filter, chose “Previous Week”. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=723))

### 5 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS FOR THE WHEEL (EASIER THAN YOU THINK)
###### ID 370175445
> With a candlestick chart each day’s trading record is shown as a rectangle with lines extending above and/or below. The rectangle is the “body” of the candle and is formed by the opening and closing prices for the day; the “wicks” are the lines extending above the rectangle, showing the high for the day, and “tails” are the lines below.

###### ID 370175446
> When a chart has long wicks or tails, traders take notice. A long wick, or group of wicks suggests selling, and if they appear on the chart after an upswing, traders expect a downturn. Likewise with tails, traders expect a change in price direction. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B095J536ZR&location=776))

As long as you’ve selected a quality stock, we recommend you take assignment. You’ll keep the premium, own a good company, and be able to write calls. Those call premiums will be quite profitable because premiums will explode in value with the increased volatility that a market crash creates.
