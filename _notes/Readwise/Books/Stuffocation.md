> So why do we keep buying more and more, even though we already have more than we need and can cope with? ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=199))

> As with anything as supersized and seismic as Stuffocation, there are many explanations. Ask a different expert, and you will hear a different emphasis. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=277))

> And finally, what do I, a cultural forecaster, think? ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=304))
    - Note: And what would a man of faith say about stuffocation? probably that it takes us away from God and makes stuff our idols.

> Instead, you are now less likely to be impressed by what people have and more likely to be interested in what they do. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=374))
    - Note: look up a scripture about this
    
###### ID 38689831
> Despite occasional victories, like the banning of the CFCs that harmed the ozone layer, environmental damage has only gotten worse through the years. The runaway success of consumerism is now not only causing what may be irreversible climate change, for instance, but also, which is perhaps worse, the greatest extinction of plant and animal species since the dinosaurs died out. Materialism might mean that whole swaths of our planet could one day wake up, as Rachel Carson foretold, to spring mornings that are entirely silent. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=767))
    - Note: stewardship is the right way to look at taking care of our planet. D&C 101:90: "And in his hot displeasure, and in his fierce anger, in his time will cut off those wicked, unfaithful, and unjust stewards, and appoint them their portion among the hypocrites, and unbelievers." D&C 104:55-56: "Behold, all these properties are mine...And if the properties are mine, then ye are stewards; otherwise, ye are no stewards." Moses 2:28, the Lord gave dominion over everything to Man: "And I, God, blessed them, and said unto them: Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl oft he air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."

> The world is not, it must be said, quite as flat as a pancake. There are still peaks of influence. The government is still far more influential than most individuals. And the world’s big media and advertising companies, like Disney, Google, and News Corp, are certainly more likely to influence what you and I think and do, and especially when and how we spend our money. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=1195))
    - Note: imagine the peak of influence that our church leaders have over some other peaks. who are we more willing to give out time and attention to?
    
###### ID 38689833
> One path that most governments and businesses do not want us to go down is minimalism. Why would they, when their economic and financial models are based on materialism, on us wanting and buying more? If the government, industrialists, and advertisers who rely on materialism had it their way, there would be no mention of minimalism. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=1201))
    - Note: the Lord however would probaly prefer a minimal lifestyle
    
###### ID 38689834
> Rather than an apathetic, can’t-be-bothered sort of outlook on life, the medium chill, as you will soon see, is a far more ambitious and active idea. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=1699))
    
###### ID 38689835
> One consequence of this is that people sacrifice too much life to get more stuff. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=1716))
    - Note: choose whom ye will serve
    
###### ID 38689836
> This, in the final analysis, is the problem with the medium chill. Although it sounds nice, and although it resonates with almost everyone, it does not feel aspirational, and it does not provide a way for people to indicate their status. After all, “Look at me, I’m in second gear” does not have much of a ring to it. So I do not think that it will appeal to most people. It will not become a mainstream alternative to materialism. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=1782))

> If you want to be happy, you should spend your money, time, and energy on experiences rather than material possessions. They are more likely to help you be happy. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00N6PEP7A&location=1859))
    - Note: why seek ye for treasures?
