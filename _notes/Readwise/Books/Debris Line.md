> When a species adapts to survive in its environment, that’s evolution. That’s all it is. We’re not evolving into something better, more enlightened. Or worse. We evolve to survive. Nothing more. And survival is amoral. It is not an enlightened state.” ([Location 3043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075ZW8QP8&location=3043))
