###### ID 665354889
> Hundreds of years ago, a failure to recognize a danger in the environment meant certain death. Genetic material that played any kind of role in that failure, was also eliminated. It couldn’t be passed along. It was the beauty of evolution. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GLYNY3K&location=1016))
    - Note: Evolution does not eliminate bad genetics. If the person has already reproduced, the genes were already passed on. It only stops if the person dies before they procreate.
