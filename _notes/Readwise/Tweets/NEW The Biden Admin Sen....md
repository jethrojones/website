## Highlights
###### ID 260757881
> NEW: The Biden Admin sent talking points out today touting their accomplishments to (some) reporters. It can only be described as a war on reality.
> Quick 🧵 to break down the end-of-year desperation they’re hoping the press will buy. ⤵️

> First, vaccination rates. Without mentioning that the Admin inherited three vaccines from their predecessor, Biden claims credit for a 70% jump in vaccination rate year-over-year.

###### ID 260757883
> A year ago, the first vaccine had been administered one week prior, so OF COURSE vax rates were low.
> But when Biden was sworn in, the US was vaccinating citizens at the 5th highest rate in the developed world. 
> That # has fallen dramatically under Biden. https://t.co/TJEH6mVk8p ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1472301277577158657))
    
###### ID 260757884
> And the school opening stat is despite, not because of, the Admin, who has repeatedly pushed for anti-science measures at the behest of the teachers’ unions. https://t.co/wwfrLS4zaZ

###### ID 260757885
> This same ham-fistedness applies to the stats on job creation, too. 
> Was anything happening in the last 3-5 months of the Trump Admin, guys? Might that factor in? 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FG6qOIPXoAEqhiW.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1472301291678351361))
    
###### ID 260757886
> Taking credit for the creation of local and state jobs is also intellectually dishonest when so many of the largest job creating states - Florida, Texas, etc. - not only didn’t vote for Biden but have (with good reason) rejected his economic advice. https://t.co/a9ZpSOTeVh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1472301293645570049))
    
###### ID 260757887
> And I mean cmon. If someone thought REALLY hard, I’m sure they could figure out why hospitality jobs have come back whether or not the Admin had done anything.

###### ID 260757888
> But it gets even more ridiculous when the Biden Admin tries to combat reality on inflation.
> Biden touts his “aggressive actions to address prices” in an attempt to elide that prices for consumer goods are near a 40 year high as a result of his policies.

###### ID 260757889
> Absent from this is that nearly 70% of Americans think Biden is doing a bad job at handling inflation and the economy. That even includes a *majority* of Dems.
> You can almost feel the desperation coming off of the memo here.

###### ID 260757890
> I mean. How bad must things be to include gas prices dropping 10 cents *below their recent highs* as a victory?

###### ID 260757891
> The Biden Admin can spin these “facts” all they want, but it clearly isn’t convincing voters. His disapproval rate is over 50%, fully 6 points below Obama’s at this point before the 2010 midterm wipeout.
> I’m sure that’ll keep the spin doctors busy. https://t.co/VaWa2YOqfa ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1472301322380664842))

> For those asking why the Biden Admin would bother doing this, the short answer is that…it works.
> Here’s @axios, which I think is among the most fair outlets, parroting back what’s on this memo (with a tiny call-out at the end about inflation) https://t.co/spJUNKTm0I ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1472402715238141958))
