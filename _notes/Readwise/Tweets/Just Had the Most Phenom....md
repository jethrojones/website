## Highlights
###### ID 454266753
> Just had the most phenomenal house cleaning (a Christmas gift for my wife) from a company called AMCleaning here in Calgary. 
> And while the clean itself was exceptional, what's equally impressive is their process, which is unlike anybody else I've come across: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke/status/1613277070456676352))

> First: you don't just ring them up and ask for a clean. 
> There's a multi-step questionnaire you go through defining your priorities/what 'clean' looks like to you, AND a call.
> It's long but focused, and importantly it doesn't feel like a chore, it feels *very* personalized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke/status/1613277071870160897))
    
###### ID 454266755
> Second: they don't follow the 'uber for cleaning people' model. 
> AMCleaning sends a "4-woman team" (their words) for 4-5 intensive hours where they cover every single element you outlined in a flurry of focused work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke/status/1613277073170370560))

> Third: They weave in their mission at every step. 
> 1. The company is run by a Ukrainian woman who hires (primarily) refugees and pays well for the industry. 
> 2. They use only natural products, some they make themselves (and gift you a sample @ end to stay top-of-mind) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke/status/1613277074445438976))
    
###### ID 454266757
> Fourth: Presentation is everything. When the house is done, if you're home, they walk you through to gauge how well they've done. 
> Blinds open, smell is fresh, lines on carpet. Even 'staged' my daughter's crib by laying out her sleep sack neatly with her soothers on top, ready. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke/status/1613277075686952962))
    
###### ID 454266758
> Fifth: beyond gifting a sample of cleaner (which will smell like your house did at its freshest), they also leave a note, and the kicker?
> In that note they highlight areas they'd 'love to' tackle next time that they didn't (e.g. inside of stove.)
> And now you trust them to. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke/status/1613277076983013376))
    
###### ID 454266759
> The whole operation is just extremely well thought out, well executed, and feels good to support. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke/status/1613277078245494788))
    
###### ID 454266760
> @mattlambert FWIW, it's something my wife sourced on her own and was super pumped about. With two kids under five, the both of us work hard to try and keep our space as clean as we can, but a deep, focused clean like this is a luxury we both massively enjoyed.
