###### ID 600284061
> Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103497725173760))
    
###### ID 600284062

###### ID 600284063

###### ID 600284064

###### ID 600284065

###### ID 600284072

###### ID 600284074
> Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002104947624722433))
    
###### ID 600284075
> Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002105081855016961))
    
###### ID 600284076
> Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002105148733206528))
    
###### ID 600284077
> When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002105194170085376))
    
###### ID 600284078
> Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002105243767787520))
    
###### ID 600284079
> Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002105652792066048))
    
###### ID 600284080
> The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002105838713028609))

> “Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” 
> - Archimedes ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106224123432960))
    
###### ID 600284082
> Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106317064949763))
    
###### ID 600284083

###### ID 600284084
> Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106698889183234))
    
###### ID 600284085
> Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106775036874752))
    
###### ID 600284086
> Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106893265920000))
    
###### ID 600284087
> An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106977273565184))
    
###### ID 600284088
> If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002107377598873600))
    
###### ID 600284089

###### ID 600284092

###### ID 600284095
> Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002108599399661568))
    
###### ID 600284096
> Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002108800457883650))
    
###### ID 600284097
> Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002108897551773697))
    
###### ID 600284098
> There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002109022420451328))
    
###### ID 600284099
