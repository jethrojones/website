> #1 The weather: Both summer and winter temperatures, according to mainstream journalists, are to blame for the increased number of heart diseases and blood clots. It seems we're just in for a heart-stopping season no matter the weather! 🤡🌎

> #2 Artificial sweeteners: According to a study, artificial sweeteners are responsible for an increased risk of heart attacks. Guess that's just another "bitter" finding in the world of "sweet" science! 🤡🌎

###### ID 577414957
> #4 Gardening: Nothing is better for the immune system than 'eating dirt'. And now suddenly, exposure to soil is supposed to increase the risk of killer heart disease? Whoever believes that probably also believes that the gene therapy is safe and effective. 🤡🌎

###### ID 577414963
> #7 Eating eggs: Eggs are among the healthiest foods one can eat. Perhaps that's why there's an attempt to convince us otherwise. This is junk science! 🤡🌎

> #11 Giving birth in early 20s: Caution to biological women in their early 20s: think twice, even thrice, before choosing to get pregnant early. According to the eugenicists aiming to depopulate the earth, having babies at a young age is life-threatening. 🤡🌎

###### ID 577414970
> #14 Weekend-lie ins: Sleeping in on the weekend is supposedly the ultimate heart-killer. Since waking up early is considered racist, it's quite challenging to make the right choice these days. 🤡🌎

###### ID 577414972
> #16 Living in rural areas: Regarding this study, living in rural areas will increase the chance getting a heart attack. Probably too much gardening and consumption of organic chicken eggs. 🤡🌎
