###### ID 591583748
> What is the “Rule of 3”?
> When you distill any topic into 3 things, you’ve got a framework.
> • “The 3 little pigs.”
> • “Bacon, lettuce, and tomato”
> • “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
> 3 makes anything memorable. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1698712679878197412))
    
###### ID 591583749
> Ali creates “3-item” constraints for topics his audience might find interesting.
> That way, he can:
> • Distill answers in a clear and concise way
> • Transform it into any type of content he wants
> Constraints eliminate decision fatigue.

###### ID 591583750
> Step 1: Turn your topic into a question.
> Ali picks a topic from his life:
> • Pains he's resolved
> • Problems he's fixed
> • Obstacles he's overcome
> • Frustrations he's alleviated
> Then he rewrites it as a question and puts it at the center of a blank document.

###### ID 591583751
> Step 2: Contextualize the question and expand it.
> Do this by asking:
> • “Why does this problem exist?”
> • “Why does this need to be solved?”
> • “What’s so important about this topic?”
> This is called Abstraction Laddering.

###### ID 591583752
> Step 3: Use the “Rule of 3”
> Create the following lists from your topic:
> • 3 reasons why your topic matters
> • 3 categories that will help the target audience with the topic
> • 3 “extra tips” to help people who are ready for the next step
> Now you have a working outline!
