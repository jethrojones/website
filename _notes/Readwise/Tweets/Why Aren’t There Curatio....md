## Highlights
###### ID 459489546
> Why aren’t there curation “podcasts”?
> Pick an industry, consume several podcasts in that industry every week, choose the best episodes to cross publish in your own RSS feed?
> Need permission from the podcaster, but it’s great for listeners and helps solve the discovery problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1615730631270342657))
    
###### ID 459489547
> Eventually podcasters will WANT to be in that feed.
> If you dynamically insert your own ads as the feed owner, super simple business model (and you get paid to listen to podcasts). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1615731414498181123))
    
###### ID 459489548
> @JKaplan1 …and it wouldn’t be stuck within the spotify ecosystem (important to the podcaster too) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1615733086037188609))
