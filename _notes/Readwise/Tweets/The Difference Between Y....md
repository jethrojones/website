> The difference between you and the creators you follow is they are creating while you are consuming.
> Here are 13 tips to make the switch from a consumer to a creator: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859099043540992))
    
###### ID 314131914
> Set a Daily “Make Something” Goal
> Grab a sticky note and write “make something today"--stick it to your computer monitor.
> Your goal is simply to make something--anything--every single day.
> Set the bar low and make it achievable.
> Creation will start to become a habit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859100234706944))
    
###### ID 314131915
> Document What You Make
> Start documenting your daily creation.
> Post it online with a few sentences about what it means to you.
> Was it an idea floating around in your head for months? A mini essay you've been meaning to write? Code that you finally figured out?
> Document it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859102080135168))
    
###### ID 314131916
> Decide Before You Start
> Too often I sit down at my computer and wonder what I should work on. That’s dangerous. 
> The Trick: Decide what you are going to do beforehand.
> Write a to do list beforehand, then immediately jump into that first task.
> Remove the guesswork. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859104026361856))
    
###### ID 314131917
> Separate Creation & Consumption
> Computers are for creating, not consuming.
> Go to all your social sites and sign out. Set up your computer as your creation hub.
> Use your phone or tablet for consumption.
> One device is used for creating, the other for consuming. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859105364275201))
    
###### ID 314131918
> Know Who You Serve
> If you try to create for everyone you’ll quickly run out of both ideas and motivation.
> Instead figure out exactly who you are serving.
> Identify your audience and niche. Develop an understanding of your "customer" and what they need.
> The ideas will flow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859106899431425))
    
###### ID 314131919
> Schedule Time for Creation
> Take control and reserve time for creating.
> Go to your calendar and set aside 30 minutes blocked for focused creation.
> Then when you get the notification you already have the time set aside and it is clear what you should start on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859108220588033))
    
###### ID 314131920
> Quit Slack
> At ConvertKit we have a simple shorthand for informing everyone else you are entering focused work: cmd + Q.
> It means "I’m quitting Slack to focus for a while."
> I always underestimate the cost of maintaining conversations while creating. It’s hard and I’m bad at it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859109541871616))
    
###### ID 314131921
> Teach What You Just Learned
> Teaching everything you know can be intimidating, so let’s start by teaching what you just learned.
> Create a new 30 minute event every Friday that says, "What did you learn this week?"
> Look back at your week and share something that you learned. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859110909190144))
    
###### ID 314131922
> Build a Streak & Don’t Break the Chain
> I built my entire blog through one habit: writing 1,000 words a day.
> That turned into writing 3 books and many blog posts.
> The key: I built a streak that I didn’t want to break--650 days in a row!
> Build a streak of creating every day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859112813359104))
    
###### ID 314131923
> Block Troublesome Sites
> If simply signing out isn’t enough, you can use software to block an entire website.
> The SelfControl app for OSX will block a series of sites for a set amount of time.
> Signing out is usually enough of a barrier, but this app takes it to the next level! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859114008793088))
    
###### ID 314131924
> Know Your Outcome
> Don’t just create for the sake of creating.
> Work towards something.
> Whether it’s launching the course, reaching 500 YouTube subscribers, writing a book, or launching a new feature--have a specific goal to chip away at.
> Vision keeps you on track! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859115644588034))
    
###### ID 314131925
> Create a Deadline, Raise the Stakes
> It’s not a real goal without a deadline.
> Set your launch date in advance. Then give $50 to a friend and have them only give it back to you if hit the goal.
> Put some skin in the game. Make sure you feel the pain if you miss your goal! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859116961583109))
    
###### ID 314131926
> Go Public
> Even better, make it a public challenge.
> I started ConvertKit through The Web App Challenge: my public challenge to build a web app to $5,000/mo in 6 months.
> My community rallied around me to help make it happen. All because I took my journey public. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbarry/status/1517859118719004672))
