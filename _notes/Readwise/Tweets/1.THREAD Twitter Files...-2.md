###### ID 466787313

> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FnfO0TvWIAA8JDX.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029823271350272))
    
###### ID 466787314
> 11. Hamilton 68 never released the list, claiming "the Russians will simply shut [the accounts] down." All those reporters and TV personalities making claims about “Russian bots” never really knew what they were describing.

###### ID 466787316

###### ID 466787318
> 14. In layman’s terms, the Hamilton 68 barely had any Russians. In fact, apart from a few RT accounts, it’s mostly full of ordinary Americans, Canadians, and British. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029849125060608))

> https://t.co/om9vyL01e5 was a scam. Instead of tracking how “Russia” influenced American attitudes, Hamilton 68 simply collected a handful of mostly real, mostly American accounts, and described their organic conversations as Russian scheming. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029851146682368))

###### ID 466787321
> 17.Some Twitter execs badly wanted to out Hamilton 68. After Russians were blamed for hyping the #ParklandShooting hashtag, one wrote:
> “Why can’t we say we’ve investigated… and citing Hamilton 68 is being wrong, irresponsible, and biased?” 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FnfQLdQacAABRUy.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029856293101568))

###### ID 466787325
> 21. So the “legitimate people,” as one Twitter exec called them, never found out they’d been used as fodder for mountains of news stories about “Russian influence.” Because the #TwitterFiles contain the list, they’ve begun finding out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029868007788544))
    
###### ID 466787326
> 22.“I’m shocked,” says Sonia Monsour, who as a child lived through civil war in Lebanon. “Supposedly in a free world, we are being watched at many levels, by what we say online.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029870088175617))

###### ID 466787328
> 24. “When I was growing up, my father told me about the McCarthyite blacklist,” says Oregon native Jacob Levich. “As a child it would never have occurred to me that this would come back, in force and broadly, in a way… designed to undermine rights we hold dear.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029875574333440))
    
###### ID 466787329
> 25. Even Twitter execs were stunned to read who was on the list. Wrote policy chief Nick Pickles about British comic @Holbornlolz: “A wind-up merchant… I follow him and wouldn’t say he’s pro-Russian… I can’t even remember him tweeting about Russia.”

###### ID 466787331
> 27. Consortium editor Joe Lauria too was angered to find he was on the list, which targeted voices across the spectrum: “Organizations like Hamilton 68 are in business to enforce an official narrative, which means excising inconvenient facts, which they call ‘misinformation.’” 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FnfQrKeaIAMrbzo.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1619029885011509249))
    
###### ID 466787332
> 28.What makes this an important story is the sheer scale of the news footprint left by Hamilton 68’s digital McCarthyism. The quantity of headlines and TV segments dwarfs the impact of individual fabulists like Jayson Blair or Stephen Glass.

###### ID 466787334
> 30.These stories raised fears in the population, and most insidious of all, were used to smear people like Tulsi Gabbard as foreign “assets,” and drum up sympathy for political causes like Joe Biden’s campaign by describing critics as Russian-aligned.

###### ID 466787335

###### ID 466787336
> https://t.co/FAazMoLnTO was a lie. The illusion of Russian support was created by tracking people like Joe Lauria, Sonia Monsour, and Dave Shestokas. Virtually every major American news organization cited these fake tales— even fact-checking sites like Snopes and Politifact.

###### ID 466787337
> 33.Twitter didn’t have the guts to out Hamilton 68 publicly but did try to speak to reporters off the record. “Reporters are chafing,” said Horne. “It’s like shouting into a void.”

###### ID 466787338
