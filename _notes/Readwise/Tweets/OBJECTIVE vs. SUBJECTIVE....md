> OBJECTIVE vs. SUBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE
> From Empirical Evidence to Personal Belief: Understanding the Dual Nature of Knowledge
> 🧵 [1/4]
> In the intricate tapestry of human history and the profound depths of religious belief, lies a delicate dance between two powerful forces: objective and subjective knowledge. This dance, often unseen yet pivotal, shapes our understanding of the world, our interpretation of the past, and our visions for the future. But what happens when these two forces collide and intertwine, challenging our perceptions of reality and truth?
> As we stand at the crossroads of history and faith, a fundamental question emerges: Can the empirical truths of our existence coexist with the deeply personal interpretations that give our lives meaning? This is not just an academic inquiry, but a journey into the heart of what it means to be human, to seek understanding in a world brimming with both concrete facts and fluid beliefs.
> Join me as we embark on a riveting exploration of objective and subjective knowledge, delving into their roles, their conflicts, and their harmonious potential. We will traverse through time and belief, unearthing the undeniable impact of these dual forms of knowledge on our interpretation of historical events, religious doctrines, and moral principles.
> In this pursuit, we are not just observers, but active participants in a quest that transcends the boundaries of history and spirituality. Prepare to challenge your perceptions, broaden your understanding, and possibly, reshape your view of the world as we know it. Welcome to a journey where every fact and feeling, every evidence and emotion, plays a crucial role in our collective search for truth.

> [2/4] Objective Knowledge
> Objective knowledge refers to information or truths that are independent of individual feelings, interpretations, or perspectives. This is the realm of empirical facts, universal laws, and indisputable events. In mathematics, for instance, the equation 1 + 1 = 2 is universally accepted, irrespective of cultural, temporal, or religious contexts. This objective nature of mathematical truths is rigorously presented in works like Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead's "Principia Mathematica", which lays the foundational principles of mathematics derived from logic.
> In the scientific realm, the law of gravity holds constant, regardless of one's beliefs or opinions. The universality of the law of gravity, as formulated by Isaac Newton in his seminal work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", stands as a testament to the objective nature of scientific laws.
> In historical contexts, certain events are considered objectively true because they are corroborated by multiple independent sources and stand up to rigorous scholarly scrutiny. For example, the existence of ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, or the Mayans is supported by a plethora of archaeological evidence, written records, and oral traditions. The objective reality of ancient civilizations like Egypt is underscored by archaeological discoveries such as the Rosetta Stone, which unlocked the secrets of Egyptian hieroglyphs and confirmed historical records.
> However, it's important to recognize that while objective truths may be universal, our understanding of them is often mediated through subjective lenses, which brings us to our next point.
> Now that we’ve explored objective knowledge, let’s delve into the realm of subjective knowledge, where personal feelings, interpretations, and perspectives come into play. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonathanaplumb/status/1729126945072492605))

> [3/4] Subjective Knowledge
> Subjective knowledge is deeply personal and rooted in individual experiences, cultural background, and belief systems. It deals with opinions, interpretations, and values that vary from person to person and cannot be quantified or measured in the way objective facts can. For example, the experience of reading a sacred text like the Bible can evoke a range of interpretations and emotional responses, none of which can be labeled as universally “true” or “false.” 
> The diversity in interpreting sacred texts like the Bible is acknowledged in documents such as "The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church" by the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which highlights the influence of various cultural and historical contexts on biblical exegesis.
> In the realm of history, subjective knowledge comes into play when we consider the significance or meaning behind events, figures, or traditions. Take, for instance, the differing perspectives on a historical figure like Joan of Arc. To some, she may be a saint and a national hero; to others, she might represent a contentious figure whose actions led to conflict. It often, but not universally, depends on which side of the conflict a person living today has descended from.
> The subjective nature of historical interpretation is exemplified in Marina Warner's "Joan of Arc: The Image of Female Heroism," which explores how Joan of Arc's legacy has been variously interpreted and reimagined across different cultures and periods.
> Interestingly, even in the seemingly objective realm of science, subjective or anecdotal evidence holds a place in the mosaic of scientific inquiry. While anecdotal evidence – personal stories or individual experiences – is often viewed with skepticism due to its inherent subjectivity, it can nonetheless play a crucial role in the scientific process. Such evidence can serve as a preliminary indicator, sparking curiosity and leading to more rigorous, systematic investigations. It is through this lens that anecdotal evidence becomes a valuable scientific tool, albeit one that cannot provide conclusive proof on its own. 
> This approach is evident in fields like psychology and medicine, where patient experiences and case studies often lay the groundwork for more extensive research. For instance, the initial observations of patient symptoms played a pivotal role in the early understanding of conditions like Alzheimer's disease. However, it's vital to recognize that while anecdotal evidence can inform and inspire scientific inquiry, it is the subsequent empirical research and validation that solidify scientific understanding. Thus, anecdotal evidence, though subjective, contributes to the scientific endeavor by highlighting potential areas for exploration, though it alone cannot establish scientific fact.
> Now that we’ve explored the realms of objective and subjective knowledge separately, let’s delve into how they interact and influence each other. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonathanaplumb/status/1729126999430713606))

> [4/4] The Interplay of Knowledge in History and Faith
> In the quest to understand world history in its full complexity, we cannot rely solely on objective facts or subjective interpretations; we need both. Objective facts provide the skeletal framework — the when, where, and what of historical events. Subjective interpretation adds the flesh and sinew, giving life to bare facts by providing context, meaning, and emotional resonance.
> John Lewis Gaddis in "The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past" eloquently illustrates how historians, much like artists, weave together objective facts with subjective interpretations to portray the complexities of history.
> In religious contexts, the distinction becomes even more poignant. For believers in the Latter-day Saint tradition, objective and subjective knowledge intertwine in unique ways. While The Book of Mormon is considered an objective, historical account of ancient peoples, its teachings also provide profound subjective experiences, inspiring moral virtues and personal revelations. This interplay enriches our spiritual lives, offering a more comprehensive understanding of divine patterns and purposes.
> Terryl L. Givens in "By the Hand of Mormon" delves into how The Book of Mormon is revered as both a historical account and a profound source of spiritual guidance, embodying the fusion of objective and subjective knowledge in the Latter-day Saint tradition.
> As we delve deeper into the tapestry of world history and explore the intricate patterns that connect diverse cultures and faiths, maintaining a balanced perspective between objective and subjective knowledge becomes crucial. This equilibrium allows us to engage critically with sources and interpretations, fostering a richer, more nuanced understanding of the world. It also aids in reconciling the often divergent paths of faith and reason, guiding us toward a harmonious synthesis that honors both the universal and the deeply personal in our quest for truth.
> Robert Sokolowski’s "The God of Faith and Reason" is an excellent source that explores the intricate relationship between faith and philosophical thought, shedding light on how these seemingly divergent paths can converge in a meaningful synthesis.
