> Everybody talks about his main book (How to Get Rich), but I think his follow up “The Narrow Road” is better. 
> Here are some favorite takeaways: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328080272293890))
    
###### ID 443905713
> First you can buy the book here. It’s worth a further study.
> https://t.co/aa4i3fTbvn
> -Tenacity will eventually trump all other qualities, whether inherited, acquired, or mimicked.
> -Forget glamour if the getting of money is your priority. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328088191066112))
    
###### ID 443905714
> -In addition, you have stamina, no track record to defend, and the single most priceless asset imaginable. What is it? The time necessary to succeed, of course! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328090581811201))
    
###### ID 443905715
> -Few are prepared to act in deadly earnest for as long as it takes. And only a minute fraction are prepared to bear the humiliation of being made to look a fool. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328098337079296))
    
###### ID 443905716
> -If you are not prepared to work longer hours than anyone you know, you will never be rich.
> -If you cannot treat your quest to get rich as a game—a silly game with serious rules—you will never be rich. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328100581031936))
    
###### ID 443905717
> -If cash flow is good, then no matter how badly run or poorly managed a company might be, there is always a chance of turning its fortunes around. At the very least, there is time enough to do so. But if cash flow is poor, panic sets in and events spiral swiftly out of control. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328107619057664))
    
###### ID 443905718
> -Obsessive monitoring and forecasting of cash levels cannot, of themselves, generate cash. But they can provide a start-up’s owner with an early warning—one that may well make the difference between ruin and survival. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328114728427520))
    
###### ID 443905719
> -Always ask yourself this question: Is this hire really necessary? So necessary that I feel certain that employing this person will enable us to generate additional income amounting to seven to ten times the new employee’s base salary?
> -Overhead grows by osmosis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328116624297985))
    
###### ID 443905720
> -If you are determined to become rich, there is only one talent you require: the talent to identify, hire, and nurture others with talent.
> -Talent is the key to sustained growth, and growth is the key to early wealth. You cannot afford to skimp on it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328118566305797))
    
###### ID 443905721
> -There are six simple rules concerning talent: identify it, hire it, nurture it, reward it, protect it from being poached. And, when the time comes, fire it.
> -Other than in the first flush of acquisition, wealth cannot confer happiness. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328120776589313))
    
###### ID 443905722
> -Wealth is preferable to poverty, but not conducive to contentment. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328128078872578))
    
###### ID 443905723
> -Human capital is the foundation of business success. A thousand here or there is a small price to pay for hiring star talent. One star is worth a dozen plodders. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328129895124992))
    
###### ID 443905724
> -As an owner, you have the right to set the destination of the ship, but not the right to give sailing orders once you have appointed an MD. Any ship piloted by two captains will sink. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328136434040832))
    
###### ID 443905725
> -Nor can you, as owner or chairman, fire other senior managers at will—that is an MD’s prerogative. You may fire your MD, but may not publicly undermine their authority. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328138489159683))
    
###### ID 443905726
> -Argue, advise, consult, and debate all you wish with your captain in private, but you may not and must not do so on deck.
> -In the heady days of start-up, a degree of risk-taking is a vital requirement for all concerned, as is the capacity for shouldering huge amounts of work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328140351524865))
    
###### ID 443905727
> -Corners will be (and must be) cut. Nimbleness of mind, flexibility in work patterns, and a messianic belief in the project are key. You are creating a pirate ship, not an oil tanker.
> -Experienced leaders will tell you of the importance of morale. It is important. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328142364778497))
    
###### ID 443905728
> -Good morale cannot compensate for sloppy work or an ill-conceived business plan, but a pervasive feeling of “us against the world” in a start-up company, combined with the promise of promotion based on achievement—this can move mountains. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328144176635907))
    
###### ID 443905729
> -Fear of failing in the eyes of the world is the single biggest impediment to amassing wealth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328146139660290))
    
###### ID 443905730
> -Trust me on this. It will cripple you. You must confront and harness it.
> -A good rule of thumb is that an external candidate for a key position should appear at least 30 percent better on the surface than an internal candidate. Why? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328148391886849))
    
###### ID 443905731
> -Because you will already be aware of the faults of the latter, such as they are. External candidates, on the other hand, come to you free of known faults.
> -Wealth may provide access, but never true ownership. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328154985447425))
    
###### ID 443905732
> -I “own” thousands of acres in England, but those who work and walk that land daily own it in a far more profound way than I ever can, or ever shall. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328156679847936))
    
###### ID 443905733
> -GK. Chesterton put it: “To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough to want it.”
> -If one chases money in the belief one can never be happy without it, in the serious belief that the chase is a meaningful occupation, I doubt the probability of success. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328158475010057))
    
###### ID 443905734
> -Contracting an incurable disease is a serious matter; the death of a loved one is a serious matter; even the rejection of your affections can be a serious matter. The making or losing of money is not a serious matter.
> -There is only one boss. The customer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328160970706945))
    
###### ID 443905735
> -And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else. -Sam Walton
> -Your customers are the final arbiters of your financial destiny. Not that they are infallible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328163059376136))
    
###### ID 443905736
> 1As Henry Ford pointed out, if he’d asked his customers what they wanted before the first Model T rolled off the assembly line, they would have asked him for faster horses that ate less. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328165068455937))
    
###### ID 443905737
> -Time spent recharging your batteries and maintaining your physical and mental health is not wasted. It is a necessity. Time frittered away attending to tasks easily achieved but relatively inessential to your ultimate goal is wasted—a criminal waste of a precious resource. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328172517621761))
    
###### ID 443905738
> -Ruthless prioritizing in the getting of money is the sign of a disciplined, determined mind; one far more likely to succeed. The happy-go-lucky may call it an obsession. So what? I doubt you will meet many happy-go-lucky souls on the narrow road. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328174639943680))
    
###### ID 443905739
> -Prioritize everything in your working day!
> -My own rule is to keep company debt, if at all possible, to less than 25 percent of annual revenues. In some years, far less. With luck, such debt could be paid off, at a pinch, within a year or eighteen months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328176724516864))
    
###### ID 443905740
> -This level of debt is perfectly manageable in most instances, but would be considered ridiculously low by other entrepreneurs. Much depends on the economic cycle and interest rates. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328178435686401))
    
###### ID 443905741
> -All who learn to delegate wisely (and early) increase their chances of success in the getting of money to a significant degree. Micromanagers, by contrast, unwittingly “kill the thing they love” and endanger their odds of making real money. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328180679663618))
    
###### ID 443905742
> -Bertrand Russell: Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth’s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328182630014977))
    
###### ID 443905743
> -Come to the edge. We might fall. Come to the edge. It’s too high! COME TO THE EDGE! And they came and he pushed and they flew… -Christopher Logue, “Come to the Edge” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328184584650753))
    
###### ID 443905744
> -Coupled with tenacity, self-belief lies at the core of the getting of money.
> -Without self-belief, nothing can be accomplished. With it, nothing is impossible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328186543390720))
    
###### ID 443905745
> -Persistence offers you a second or third bite at the cherry. Tenacity ensures that you will continue to search for alternative ways to succeed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328188481060864))
    
###### ID 443905746
> -Self-belief encourages you to stare down failure and naysayers while tenacity works its magic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328194755829761))
    
###### ID 443905747
> -Riding is always preferable to walking, just as cashing out a little early in the getting of money is preferable to all-out war with a better-resourced enemy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328196567781376))
    
###### ID 443905748
> 1From my perspective, public companies are not sane places and their share prices are not decided by sane people, even though one such company made me very rich. Perhaps it is different when a company has been public for decades. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328198765596674))

###### ID 443905750
> -Breaking your neck is a misfortune. Losing someone you love is a tragedy. Failing to accumulate a fortune on the narrow road is not a misfortune, it’s just a part of the game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328202951499776))
    
###### ID 443905751
> -As H. L. Mencken put it: “The chief value of money lies in the fact that one lives in a world in which it is overestimated.”
> -Financial losses are temporary reverses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328204780179461))
    
###### ID 443905752
> -How many times can you “pick yourself up, dust yourself down, and start all over again” following a business reversal? Even a catastrophic one? For those intent on the getting of money, the answer must be: “As many times as it takes.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/taylorawelch/status/1546328206785003521))
