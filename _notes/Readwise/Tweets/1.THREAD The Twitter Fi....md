###### ID 450364510

###### ID 450364511
> 9.Twitter was also trying to reduce the number of agencies with access to Roth. “If these folks are like House Homeland Committee and DHS, once we give them a direct contact with Yoel, they will want to come back to him again and again,” said policy director Carlos Monje.

> 10.When the State Department/GEC – remember this was 2020, during the Trump administration – wanted to publicize a list of 5,500 accounts it claimed would “amplify Chinese propaganda and disinformation” about COVID, Twitter analysts were beside themselves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394224142483456))
    
###### ID 450364513
> 11.The GEC report appeared based on DHS data circulated earlier that week, and included accounts that followed “two or more” Chinese diplomatic accounts. They reportedly ended up with a list “nearly 250,000” names long, and included Canadian officials and a CNN account:

###### ID 450364515
> 13.The GEC was soon agreeing to loop in Twitter before going public, but they were using a technique that had boxed in Twitter before. “The delta between when they share material and when they go to the press continues to be problematic,” wrote one comms official.

###### ID 450364517
> 15.“IT MAKES SENSE TO PUSH BACK ON GEC PARTICIPATION IN THIS FORUM” When the FBI informed Twitter the GEC wanted to be included in the regular “industry call” between companies like Twitter and Facebook and the DHS and FBI, Twitter leaders balked at first. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FllBeApXgAIzxSv.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394238491004929))
    
###### ID 450364518

> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FllBfdqWQAMEgUp.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610394241028526084))
    
###### ID 450364519
> 17.A deeper reason was a perception that unlike the DHS and FBI, which were “apolitical,” as Roth put it, the GEC was “political,” which in Twitter-ese appeared to be partisan code. 
> “I think they thought the FBI was less Trumpy,” is how one former DOD official put it.

###### ID 450364520
> 18.After spending years rolling over for Democratic Party requests for “action” on “Russia-linked” accounts, Twitter was suddenly playing tough. Why? Because, as Roth put it, it would pose “major risks” to bring the GEC in, “especially as the election heats up.”

###### ID 450364521

###### ID 450364522
> 20.Eventually the FBI argued, first to Facebook, for a compromise solution: other USG agencies could participate in the “industry” calls, but the FBI and DHS would act as sole “conduits.”

###### ID 450364526
> 23."BELLY BUTTON" “We can give you everything we’re seeing from the FBI and USIC agencies,” Chan explained, but the DHS agency CISA “will know what’s going on in each state.” He went on to ask if industry could “rely on the FBI to be the belly button of the USG."

###### ID 450364532

###### ID 450364534
