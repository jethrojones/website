> There is a deeply flawed assumption in K-12 education that introducing new technology and/or curriculums into schools and districts will radically change teacher practice. The implication is that the tools teachers use dictate how teachers teach. That isn’t true. Teachers deploy a methodology of teaching and leverage curriculum and technology to make the learning experience as rigorous, data-driven, and efficient as possible. If we don’t introduce new methods of teaching that replace antiquated one-size-fits-all approaches to teaching, there will continue to be a ceiling on the amount of change we can see in classrooms. Moreover, our investments in really high-quality curriculums and technology will never be maximized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Kareemfarah23/status/1702804581363667328))
