> How to create high quality vector illustrations using Midjourney (Part 4)
> Want to make multiple vector style illustrations with the same theme and color scheme?
> Use this prompt:
> 4 png images, vector illustration pack, knolling style, no border, png white background, [subject], in the style of animated illustrations, [environment], full body --style raw --stylize 50
> Here are the key elements of the prompt:
> 1. 4 png images
> In theory, you can create as many as you want.
> But I always stick to 4, because too many can reduce the quality of the images.
> 2. Vector illustration pack
> This tells Midjourney you want a pack of similar images.
> 3. Knolling style
> Sometimes Midjourney doesn't listen to your instructions. Adding this makes the prompt more stable.
> With this prompt, you can generate a set of images in one go.
> This gives you pictures with a consistent theme and color scheme.
> Take a look at the images below to see what I mean.
> The prompt is in the ALT.
> I hope you find this information useful!
> I share practical Midjourney prompts and tutorials like this daily.

> Some tips:
> 1. To touch up the images, use Midjourney inpainting.
> 2. To increase the resolution of the images, use this website: huggingface. co/spaces/doevent/Face-Real-ESRGAN
> 3. To turn the png images into svg files, use vectorizer. ai
