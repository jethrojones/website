## Highlights
###### ID 476009370
> I created all the graphs in this viral thread within a day of first using MidJourney, a DALL-E-like AI image generation system.
> I think the technology is transformative to how we relate to art and design. Everyone should try it. Here is a thread on how to, in under 10 minutesðŸ§µ https://t.co/Gjs4oY23Y3 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1554264505135292417))

> Setup is easy. You can create a a bunch of images for free on MidJourney, and anyone can get access here: https://t.co/9WNH0W3AIV
> You use it by communicating with a bot, on Discord. Here is a guide to Discord: https://t.co/f6OJfxSuWI
> Then all you need to do is type /imagine https://t.co/jhLEYNYoLu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1554264506683072513))
    
###### ID 476009372
> Now, you can tell MidJourney what to do to improve the images (or try again). 
> The four images are numbered going clockwise from the upper left. To get a variation on one you like, select "V1" (or V2, V3, or V4), to get a high resolution copy, select "U1" (or U2, U3, or U4). https://t.co/GT7rUKI6uL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1554264508062892033))
    
###### ID 476009373
> There is a complex syntax that MidJourney can use, which I didn't bother to learn, I just started adding adjectives. "Photorealistic" is a very useful one. 
> Experiment for delightful and disappointing outcomes, or you can use these tools & lists to help: https://t.co/IFjl8X763d ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1554267266946146310))
    
###### ID 476009374
> There are important questions over whether this art, or pastiche, or disrespectful to artistsðŸ‘‡
> But, as somebody with only okay art skills, the ability to play with images and ideas in the way that MidJourney allows is exhilarating & very generative. https://t.co/pAnhJG8OKM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1554268354298388482))
