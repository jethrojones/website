## Highlights
###### ID 440934066
> My cofounder @homsiT and I are increasingly being asked for advice on how to build a *sustainable* consumer saas business.
> Let me share some thoughts on the single most important concept we wish we knew before starting @readwise.
> It's called ðŸ“ˆ CARRYING CAPACITY ðŸ“ˆ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831165561049089))
    
###### ID 440934067
> (Why listen to us?)
> (We're still early in our journey, but we have been working on @readwise for 5 years now, and we have created a sustainable business, so I like to think weâ€™ve learned some lessons along the way.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831168195076096))
    
###### ID 440934068
> (Also, modeling saas companies is like underwriting cash flow businesses, which happens to be my pre-@readwise expertise coming from a 10+ year career in real estate private equity.)
> (Excel is the *one* domain where I'm not a wordcel ðŸ˜›) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831170745212930))
    
###### ID 440934069
> We first learned of *carrying capacity* from our advisor @rahulvohra (CEO of @superhuman).
> In a series of LinkedIn posts from 2015, he defined it as:
> "The number of users where the rate at which we lose users equals the rate at which we gain users."
> https://t.co/45KiJyrTRy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831173291155456))
    
###### ID 440934070
> Carrying capacity is particularly important in consumer saas because you have true churn ðŸ˜¥
> This is in stark contrast to enterprise where the best companies not only don't lose customers, but those customers grow in size over time.
> (This is referred to as "negative net churn") ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831175916802048))
    
###### ID 440934071
> An enterprise biz like @superhuman might first land 2 users inside a company and then gradually expand throughout the org, increasing revenue from that account.
> Sure, they lose some accounts, but the expansions more than offset the losses.
> Negative net churn is actually growth. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831178466852864))
    
###### ID 440934072
> In consumer, there is no land & expand, corporate inertia, true network effects, or even switching costs.
> You *will* lose subscribers. Period.
> It's especially pronounced in consumer productivity (versus, say, entertainment):
> https://t.co/IWrFE4BQpz ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831181012869121))
    
###### ID 440934073
> Churn is best thought of as: "What percentage of my subscriber base will cancel their subscription each month?"
> As your customer base scales, you'll notice the number of subscribers cancelling each month steadily increases even though the percentage churn remains ~fixed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831183927922688))
    
###### ID 440934074
> Eventually, the number of existing customers cancelling each month will equal the number of new customers subscribing.
> ðŸ‘† This is carrying capacity.
> Itâ€™s an asymptote. You're done growing. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FekimWZVEAAR60A.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831191561580545))
    
###### ID 440934075
> Unlike @eugenewei's *invisible asymptotes* sneaking up on a business as complex as Amazon, you can see the carrying capacity of a simple saas business coming a mile away.
> You can even calculate it as (a) average new subscribers per month divided by (b) monthly churn. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FekimuMVIAAbvr3.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831197211283456))
    
###### ID 440934076
> If you're adding ~1,000 subscribers/mo with a monthly churn of 10%, your carrying capacity is 10,000 subscribers.
> At capacity, each month you're losing 1,000 subs (10,000 x 10%) while replacing them with 1,000 new subs.
> The limit, sadly, does exist. https://t.co/8kvQH4Pad1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831213753552896))
    
###### ID 440934077
> "But you've assumed growth is linear! Isn't growth viral?"
> I had a hard time believing this too, but @rahulvohra (as always) was right. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FekioCHUoAA_Ms2.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831220795838464))
    
###### ID 440934078
> What you'll discover is your consumer saas growth is surprisingly constant and linear.
> There will be spikes here & there, but the trend is predominantly linear due to a mix of app stores, WOM, paid advertising, integrations, SEO/SEM, influencers, hustling, referrals, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831223882862594))
    
###### ID 440934079
> The subscriber growth shared by @substack influencers such as our friend @packym hammer this home.
> This is exactly what the growth chart of a (successful) consumer saas product looks like in the 2022 era.
> https://t.co/xz6ZEENXru ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831226428792832))
    
###### ID 440934080
> We've now covered the basics.
> Let's apply them to a fictional but typical consumer productivity saas biz.
> I'm basing "typical" on a half decade of talking to other founders in the space, reading everything I can (thanks @readwise), and, of course, my own experience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831229243121665))
    
###### ID 440934087
> Assume you spend your first ~2 years building a really good product that people will actually pay for.
> During this free beta period, you accumulate 100,000 active users.
> (For the record, this would be world class hustle & retention for a first-time founder.) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831231805857792))
    
###### ID 440934088
> For reference, we launched the @readwise MVP in May 2017.
> After 1 year, we had 3K users. (lol, yes)
> After 2 years, 10K.
> After 3 years, 30K.
> These are onboarded users. Not active users. Not paying customers.
> 0 to 100K in 2 years would be a feat, but let's go with it anyways. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831234288926721))
    
###### ID 440934089
> Before charging, you have to decide between free trial or freemium.
> Freemium will offer greater top of funnel growth, but lesser conversion. Free trial the opposite.
> Assume you choose freemium to maintain growth and not alienate your beloved beta users.
> https://t.co/r7Dsf5Bkbh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831236931342336))
    
###### ID 440934090
> Now you have to decide on pricing.
> Pricing is an unbelievably hard decision, well beyond the scope of this thread.
> For our purposes, let's just assume you paywall a subset of premium features for $8.33/mo ($100/yr) comparable to other productivity tools. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831239787646976))
    
###### ID 440934091
> You're ready to announce your premium plan and officially start charging.
> How many of your existing 100,000 active users will convert to premium?
> Rule of thumb conversion rates on freemium are ~2% to 5%.
> https://t.co/u5w8JCOrRj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831242341908480))
    
###### ID 440934092
> You can assume your earliest users will convert the best because these are the users who love you the most.
> So letâ€™s use the upper end of the range (5%) for the initial paywall event.
> 100,000 x 5% = 5,000 subscribers paying $100/yr = $500K ARR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831244950839296))
    
###### ID 440934093
> How will you grow from here?
> You can look at your historical website traffic and signup rates to make an educated guess, baking in new growth initiatives.
> For our example, let's assume youâ€™ll add 50,000 new signups per month (to be clear, this would be ~INSANELY GOOD~ ðŸ¤¯). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831247517700097))
    
###### ID 440934094
> How many signups convert to paid?
> Let's return to benchmark of ~2% to 5%.
> Assume it drops to 3.5% as you're spreading to less core users.
> 50,000 x 3.5% = 1,750 new subscribers per month
> This is ~60/day, which any consumer saas founder will tell you is a huge day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831250072039424))
    
###### ID 440934095
> Now we have a starting subscriber base (5,000), ARPU ($100/yr) and monthly growth (1,750/mo).
> The final number we need is churn.
> We can look to @lennysan who's compiled the best benchmarks around.
> https://t.co/q3Ie97Nyzg ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831252613758976))
    
###### ID 440934096
> One caveat is that his GREAT numbers are for generational consumer cos like @spotify and @netflix.
> A more down-to-earth assumption for your biz might be something like @duolingo which retains ~20% after 1 year.
> Let's use the GOOD churn midpoint: 4%/mo.
> https://t.co/sucbuskiw2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831255394582530))
    
###### ID 440934097
> Now we can calc carrying capacity.
> 1,750 subs/mo divided by 4% churn/mo = 43,750 subs
> At $100 ARPU, that's $4.4M ARR.
> This is as big as this consumer product will get. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831258112516096))
    
###### ID 440934098
> We can also plot what the long slow saas ramp of death will look like for this co.
> Building for 2 years, converting 5,000 initial subs, adding 1,750/mo thereafter, and churning 4%/mo results in a 5- to 6-year journey to asymptotic growth. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FekiqqkVUAEpTux.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831266396262400))
    
###### ID 440934099
> Sidenote: The term "long slow saas ramp of death" comes from a talk given by @Gail_Goodman about her journey building Constant Contact. Highly recommended.
> This thread is really just a redux of that talk and @rahulvohra's articles on carrying capacity.
> https://t.co/Y82sXHgPoY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831270036979712))
    
###### ID 440934100
> This is truly what a *successful* consumer saas business looks like.
> You can play with ARPU, steady state growth, and churn, but they'll only stretch so much.
> e.g., it's hard to charge more than $20/mo (in consumer) or drive churn below 2%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831272658419712))
    
###### ID 440934101
> As an entrepreneur, the assumption you'll push back on is growth: both the magnitude and the linearity.
> Trust me. I get it.
> But I would advise you not to expect to outperform the base rates unless you're deep in the idea maze with a validated breakthrough. Growth is HARD. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831275279777792))
    
###### ID 440934102
> Generally the way you grow your company from here is to go multi-product (eg @basecamp), but this is easier said than done.
> In many ways, it's like starting over.
> (I now speak from experience thanks to @ReadwiseReader.)
> https://t.co/3a2QDKShur ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831277863489539))
    
###### ID 440934103
> If youâ€™re lucky, maybe you find a way to pivot to bottoms up enterprise (moving out of consumer) or find some kind of network effects / growth loop.
> But these transformations are rare.
> If you this is the outcome you seek, you should just avoid consumer saas from the get-go. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831280686264320))
    
###### ID 440934104
> I know the idea of spending 5+ years to build a ~$3.5M ARR biz is a tough pill to swallow.
> If you had explained all this to me before @readwise, I wouldn't have believed you.
> Even a few years in, I wouldn't have because churn takes so long to notice! But this is how it goes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831283257364482))
    
###### ID 440934105
> Returning to the original question around sustainability:
> If you have a consumer software product you want to work on, we advise you to plan to operate within the limits of this carrying capacity math.
> Hopefully you outperform, but hope is not a strategy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831285815943168))
    
###### ID 440934106
> It should also be obvious now why VC is unsustainable for this type of business.
> Why raise $10M to spend 5 grueling years on a startup that's barely worth your liquidation preference?
> If you want to go VC-scale, just go enterprise or consumer social.
> Those are the ways. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1578831288319909888))
