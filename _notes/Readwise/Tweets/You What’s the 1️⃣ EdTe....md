> You: What’s the 1️⃣ EdTech story that all should know ?
> Me: One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)
> You: Why ?
> Me: Many have heard of it, few know the details of it’s shocking failure & it is a great example of what I call:
> “The iceberg theory of EdTech”
> But its start was full of promise…

> Great sounding idea: One Laptop Per Child ✅
> Charismatic leader: Nicholas Negroponte ✅
> Famous University: MIT ✅
> Press adoration: NYT, Time & others ✅
> Lauded designer: Yves Béhar ✅
> Hit TED talk ✅
> Millions in funding ✅
> UN Secretary General does your demo: Priceless 🤩 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503326346141708))
    
###### ID 235208342
> This demo is a great place to start.
> It’s 2005 & Nicholas Negroponte is with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
> They are demoing a prototype laptop which they announce as a technology marvel.
> It will cost $100 (1/10th of competition) & will transform education in poor countries. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503328527179785))
    
###### ID 235208343
> An innovative feature of this laptop is its power crank.
> Turn it for 1 min. & the laptop runs for 40 mins.
> The audience begs Annan to give it a turn.
> Annan rotates the crank &…
> The laptop does nothing but the crank immediately falls off.
> A metaphor if there ever was one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503331060535299))
    
###### ID 235208344
> Sadly this repeated with most of the flashy features: 
> • So rugged that it won’t break: they broke a lot
> • Mesh networking so 1 laptop could give internet to others: didn’t work
> • Built for creation: Struggled as battery drained quickly, screen was poor, processor was slow ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503333598167049))
    
###### ID 235208345
> In the end the OLPC’s XO-1 laptop which shipped in 2007, was a far-cry from those early pitches.
> And by then PC makers had introduced their own version of cheaper laptops: netbooks.
> They worked much better than OLPC’s laptop & made OLPC look like an outdated toy in comparison. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503335842123794))
    
###### ID 235208346
> But the challenge of designing, manufacturing & maintaining laptops was not the only thing they had under-estimated. 
> Their distribution plan was that governments would buy & give these to their students. 
> Anyone who has worked with governments can guess what happened… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503337914109968))
    
###### ID 235208347
> Countries said yes then said no.
> There were long delays & endless meetings.
> Orders were placed & then cancelled. 
> Negroponte finally admitted: “I have to some degree underestimated the difference between shaking the hand of a head of state and having a check written.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503339956707333))
    
###### ID 235208348
> These are common challenges in working with governments with no simple solutions.
> But what surprised everyone was how unprepared OLPC was for these issues.
> An early supporter “We were excited about the prospects, but kind of scared by the over-simplistic plan, or lack of plan,” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503342045491206))
    
###### ID 235208349
> Negroponte had predicted initial sales of 5 to 15 million & then 100s of millions.
> But Year 1 was only 600k & in the end only 3M laptops were made.
> What followed were huge funding & staff cuts, many re-orgs & then Negroponte left. 
> OLPC now exists as a shadow of its past self. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503344092237834))
    
###### ID 235208350
> But this is not where the story ends. 
> Because there is one big questions we haven’t covered till now. 
> A question that must be on most educators’ minds: 
> What happened to all the students & schools that actually received the laptops? 
> Well for a long time we didn’t know… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503346516549634))
    
###### ID 235208351
> Negroponte was so convinced in his vision that he dismissed all evaluations as a waste of time.
> So all OLPC shared were anecdotes & distribution numbers.
> But this has changed in recent years with some independent evaluations & @morgangames brilliant book: The Charisma Machine ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503348823412744))
    
###### ID 235208352
> She is one of the few people to have done extensive field work on OLPC. 
> She spent a lot of time visiting schools in Paraguay which was seen as one of the most successful OLPC models. 
> She also visited Uruguay & Peru where ~75% of all OLPC laptops were deployed. 
> She shared: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503351172231174))
    
###### ID 235208353
> In Paraguay there was a lot of enthusiasm.
> There was a committed local NGO managing the project and schools-teachers-parents were excited for it.
> Yet within a few years only ~ 40% of children had working laptops.
> Even from them, more than half barely used them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503353370116096))
    
###### ID 235208354
> Most children had other interests (like football) or other responsibilities (like helping family).
> The few children that used their laptops used it to go to the internet, download music, watch videos & play basic games.
> Similar to the things that most of us use our devices for. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503355609862144))
    
###### ID 235208355
> Others had similar findings:
> From a 2012 controlled study in Peru: “there is no evidence that the program increased learning in Math or Language…. The program did not affect attendance or time allocated to homework.”
> Studies in Uruguay also found no impact. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503358629756931))
    
###### ID 235208356
> But this was not the pitch.
> Negroponte claimed, “We can hand these laptops out and walk away and the kids will take them up fully and learn.”
> In fact the full vision was that children would then turn around & teach their parents & teachers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503361142132736))
    
###### ID 235208357
> It was a shockingly poor understanding of the problems they were solving.
> Their solution was a generalisation of their own unique experiences (hacking a computer as a child)
> It ignored the varied interests that children have & the challenges children from poor backgrounds face. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503363683885059))
    
###### ID 235208358
> In fact Ames shared that in Paraguay she found that only 40 of the 40,000 students served by OLPC were doing interesting things with their laptops. 
> Some had photoblogs, others played around with the Scratch tool & learnt some technical skills.
> What was common for most of them? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503365818793988))
    
###### ID 235208359
> ‘Enthusiastic Teachers & care-givers who gave support & encouragement to the children to use their laptops for creation & not just for consumption.’
> Caring mentors & supporting environment are important. 
> Who knew!
> Experienced educators must be pulling their hair by now. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503367978807314))
    
###### ID 235208360
> But many EdTech enthusiasts see it differently:
> • OLPC focussed on hardware. We are software & cloud based.
> • OLPC had infra issues. We are riding the Mobile-Internet-Covid wave.
> • OLPC had distribution & funding issues. We have that sorted.
> All fine points.
> All incomplete. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503370159915017))
    
###### ID 235208361
> There is no re-visiting the utopian & untested educational ideas behind OLPC.
> No stopping to check if they have actually understood the challenges students-teachers-schools face.
> No pondering over this: 
> Why was there no impact even in places where the project worked well ? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503372743581710))
    
###### ID 235208362
> This brings me to my ‘Iceberg theory of EdTech.’
> All the focus is on the 1/10th part which is visible: The TECH of EdTech
> When we sell the promise of EdTech: we focus on Tech
> When we analyse the failure of EdTech: we focus on Tech ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503375268552706))
    
###### ID 235208363
> The part that is constantly ignored is the 9/10th part of the iceberg. 
> The part which is hidden from view: The ED of EdTech 
> This is why it seems like we are stuck in an endless loop with EdTech. 
> Every decade we try the same ideas that failed in the past. 
> Why ? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503377218850818))
    
###### ID 235208364
> Because the tech is now better.
> And when the ideas fail again, we conclude: 
> ‘too early, lets wait for the tech to get better.’
> Maybe the issue is NOT with how well the Tech works. 
> Maybe the issue is with how well we know what works in Ed & how well we apply it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gauravsingh961/status/1438503379232178177))
