> I attribute a lot of my success to running every major career decision through this test from age 20 onward: 
> Which route will increase the odds of me being able to do whatever I want with 100% my time when I’m 35 yrs old?

> It turns out, when I really did the math, I didn’t need a unicorn startup. 
> I needed to stash about $1MM (after tax) by 27 and then invest it wisely from there. 
> Definitely wasn’t going to happen with grad school or law. 
> And most normal jobs didn’t cut it either. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444034904117350))
    
###### ID 676610755
> So I started a small business with really crappy competition and a sure-bet way to make $250k a year for a few years straight. 
> The rest is history. 
> And I achieved my goal 5 years early. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444036174950496))

> 15 yrs (the time horizon back when I was 20) was a long time I guess. 
> And I ate ramen and skipped a few fun party trips I couldn’t afford. 
> And I didn’t buy a new car or a big house as soon as I had the cash to do it sitting in the bank. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444037332599050))

> The funny thing is how fast it happened. 
> It took me to 28 to have a $1MM net worth. 
> I was behind schedule. 
> But by 31, I was well beyond my stretch goals.
> It turns out you get better at life and making money becomes easier as you can take larger and larger high-probability bets. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444038645469618))

> Momentum is a hell of a real thing. 
> If I would have shot for the moon on day one I would have failed. 
> I’d have a job right now. And you wouldn’t be reading this post. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444039861850548))

> For those that don't know: 
> My partner and I leveraged about $250k each + $500k from investors to build a self storage facility. 
> We kept the rest of the cash on the sidelines just in case. 
> We kept our service business running too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444041115894151))

> 2.5 years later that $2.5MM building was worth $5MM. 
> We did a cash-out-refinance and pulled out $2MM in cash. 
> And used that to buy 10 more buildings. 
> And then it really started piling up fast. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444042290323907))

> And then stuff started happening on the internet and I've now started multiple other successful cash-flowing companies and it's gotten even crazier.
> Here's an example from the last 8 months.

> And that’s it folks. 
> I’m just a guy who got a 23 on his ACT and was the last guy accepted into college (and only because the track coach worked to get me in). 
> But now I just do what I want all day. 
> And it turns out for 30 hrs a week or so that’s work. 
> But it’s fun work! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444045444407300))

> The interesting thing about all of this: 
> The choice that leads to the most ego / status is rarely the choice that leads to the most likely chance of doing what you want when you’re 35. 
> Also the choice that leads to the “possibility” of big money in the near term typically isn’t the way. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1757444047021457438))
