###### ID 477805536
> I came across an Airtable with company data.
> Google CAN crawl Airtables, but they don't rank very well at all.
> I knew that this data would do much better as a blog post... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicheSiteLady/status/1626576462005272577))
    
###### ID 477805537
> Putting the data into a 3,000-word blog post was a big job, so I got Chat GPT to help.
> First, I saved the Artable as pdf.
> I put it into Google Drive and opened it with Google Docs.
> This gave me a table that I could paste into ChatGPT.... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicheSiteLady/status/1626576957553909761))
    
###### ID 477805538
> I pasted one section at a time and asked Chat GPT to make the data into a paragraph.
> Because I had fed the AI all of the facts, I knew that the output would be factually correct.
> I checked to make sure it didn't add anything extra and edited the output slightly when needed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicheSiteLady/status/1626577210067849216))
    
###### ID 477805539
> I also had ChatGPT write the title, meta description and intro.
> I threw in a few stock photos. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicheSiteLady/status/1626577466356641792))
    
###### ID 477805540
> After I hit publish, I sent the article to my email list.
> I think that getting some non-Google traffic to an article can be helpful to show Google that it's good.
> The next day I saw a spike in my analytics and was shocked to see that it was from this new post - and from Google! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicheSiteLady/status/1626577971107569664))
    
###### ID 477805541
> Will it get 100,000 visits per month?
> Possibly! I'll keep you updated.
> Until then, why not see if you can find more Airtables, PDFs, Google Sheets or other data that you can ask ChatGPT to put into paragraphs for you? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicheSiteLady/status/1626578500483182592))
