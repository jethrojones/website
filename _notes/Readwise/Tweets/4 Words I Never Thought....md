## Highlights

> 4 words I never thought I would say at the age of 35: 
> “I had a stroke” 
> Yes. You read that correctly. On Thursday, Nov 16th, 2023 at 7:45am I had a stroke in my home. At the age of 35. 
> To say it was scary was an understatement. It was the most anxious, terrifying, helpless feeling of my life 
> My wife and oldest son watched in fear and worry as I stood there in front of them. I cannot ever unsee the look on their faces. 
> Here’s what happened: (my way of processing that day)
> (Spoiler alert for those not wanting to read. The brain clot is gone, and I am back to 'normal'. There is a hole in my heart that will have to be repaired to avoid future issues. God is good, all the time)
> I woke up a little later than normal and decided that I was not going to workout that morning. I was in our school room when Graysen came down and asked if he could go on the computer to browse Amazon for his Christmas shopping list.
> He was on the computer and I walked into the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee (the white and pink mug below.) It gives me a little anxiety even holding that mug.
> After I poured my coffee, I was walking back into the room with Graysen when I dropped my phone (with my right hand). Not thinking anything of it, I reached down to pick up the phone, and that's when I knew...
> My right arm was numb and not working. I didn't have the fine motor skills at that moment to grab the phone off the ground. I set the coffee cup down and grabbed it with my left hand and immediately walked upstairs to our room.
> Luckily, April was getting out of bed when I walked into the room. I was about to tell her what happened downstairs, but all I could do was stare at her.
> "What's up? What are you doing? Mike!!? Mike what's going on!?!?" She immediately knew something wasn't right. (thank God I married this woman, she literally saved my life with her quick action)
> All that I could do was blank stare at her and then mumble a few things that didn't make any sense. I was conscious and aware during all of it.
> It was the most terrified and helpless I have ever been in my whole life. Gaven had slept on our floor that night and was in there for the whole thing. 
> He had tears in his eyes and I could see he wanted to come give me a hug, but we had to leave immediately. The tough man that he is becoming, he stayed with the other kids until my sister-in-law came.
> "How could this be happening to me? I am the healthy one. I'm young. I'm the one that needs to be strong for the family. They shouldn't be taking care of me!"
> All the thoughts going through my head in the milliseconds before getting downstairs
> My arm was numb, my leg was going numb, and I was beginning to panic. (but I could still walk)
> I remember getting a normal T-shirt on and frantically pacing the bedroom without being able to speak. April got a hold of her sister and said:
> "Hey you need to get over here now!" (later felt like she needed to apologize for being so bossy 🤣)
> On the ride to Thedacare, I began getting some tingling in my arm and leg and was able to speak a little bit. It was very slurred and made ZERO sense. 
> I was panicking too. April had me put my seat down to try and relax, but I couldn't.
> When we got to the ER she asked if I could walk. I shook my head and said yea. 
> "go in and tell them you have stroke-like symptoms. I am going to park the car and will be right behind you!", she said.
> I walked into the ER and like a good husband said "I'm having stroke-like symptoms"
> "ok, sir. Name and date of birth?"
> I froze. I couldn't speak again... 
> They came out from behind the counter and got me a wheelchair. My 5-month pregnant wife came running in and gave them all the information they needed.
> I sat there... It seemed like an ENTERNITY, but April assured me it was only a minute or 2.
> I got back into a room and then the work began, and it happened fast. 
> CT scans, blood draws, MRI's, medicines. Test after test.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_TuG4yW4AAwFsW.jpg'/><img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_TuG4vWgAAxWc_.jpg'/><img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_TuG4yXAAAaE2C.jpg'/><img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_TuG4yXkAAxPmn.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/meetmikehiggins/status/1726266371258950116))

> They found the blood clot and got me the medicine I needed. If it wasn't for my wife, I may have not been able to get the medicine in the timeframe needed.
> The rest of the story is relatively happy. I began recovering quickly. So quickly in fact that they took me off of bed rest the same day they gave me the TNK medicine.
> They did find a hole in my heart that was the likely culprit to allow the clot to jump to my brain. That will need to be fixed soon.
> I was up and walking the halls within hours of being admitted. My nurse, Jake, who was INCREDIBLE btw, said that he had never seen that before. 
> I was happy to be up because that meant I could pee in a toilet instead of in a plastic bottle for 24 hours.
> If you see me today, I am as normal as I was the Wednesday before going into the hospital. On the outside, it all is well.
> The lingering effects for me are mental:
> - I am a little scared each night to go to bed
> - I don't want to be far from my family at any time
> - My arm fell asleep the first night from lying on my side and that scared me a lot.
> - There is no way to look at that pink coffee cup the same way again.
> I am eternally thankful that God chose to spare me. His healing power is real, and the power of prayer from those around me was felt.
> My hope is that you get done reading this and hug your loved ones a little tighter. Don't sweat the small stuff. Love in every moment. Be present in all moments. Have gratitude for the breath you just had, the words you just spoke, and the steps you just took.
> There are so many 'thank you' posts that are deserved. My wife April is the hero in all of this. 
> She knew within seconds of my stroke and without her quick action, this post may be looking very different.
> Sara Coron for coming to our house in less than 10 minutes to take care of our kids. My mom, Kim Higgins-Olson for immediately jumping in her car and driving down to stay with our family while April and I were in the hospital. Not only did she take care of everyone, but her strength in those days for our kids was unmatched.
> Watching her only child in a hospital bed with wires coming out of every area... I can only imagine the fear and worry in her heart.
> So many of you offered to take our kids, come to our house and bring meals. 
> Thanks to our neighbor Ally, who stayed with the kids for a bit when mom left before we got home. 
> Michael Green! My incredible friend and brother from another mother. He was on the phone with April and I no less than 10 times when I was in the hospital. Helping us navigate the decisions and options. I love you man.
> Countless others who reached out and started a prayer chain. 
> My NEWCHAA Eagles family. Jacobs Well. Redemption Hill. Lake Lundgren, and many more.
> This post won't possibly allow me to tag everyone who sent messages to April and I, but know that we are so appreciative of all the messages and calls. Love you all.
> The future will be full of more tests and a likely surgery to fill the hole in the heart, and after that we should be smooth sailing and back to normal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/meetmikehiggins/status/1726266610611032225))
