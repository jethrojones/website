> 5.) Direct social followers to your newsletter
> Append every Thread and every carousel with a Call To Action to subscribe to your newsletter for more.

> And every subscriber counts! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1614770797242884096))

> 7.) Cross-promote with other newsletters

> 8.) Roll out newsletter sponsorship
> It's pretty common to get ~$30 per CPM ($30 per 1,000 subscribers) in newsletter sponsorship.
> At 10,000 subscribers, that's $300 per newsletter advertisement which is $1200-1500 per month!
> This can really add up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1614770801059799041))
    
###### ID 457634231
> 9.) Create a digital product
> Through your email replies and consulting calls, you will identify patterns in the problems your audience have.
> Create a low-priced digital product (a course or Notion template) to address that problem.
> Add it to your welcome sequence and footer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1614770802389573640))
    
###### ID 457634232
> 10.) Increase ad inventory
> Once you're consistently filling your newsletter sponsor slots, increase your ad inventory. 
> Two options:
> â€¢ Adding a second slot per email
> â€¢ Publishing two emails per week
> This doubles your sponsorship revenue overnight! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1614770803773476867))

###### ID 457634234
> 12.) Ignore distractions
> The more your audience grows, the more "opportunities" will come your way.
> Most of these are actually distractions in disguise.
> Instead of starting new projects from zero, keep compounding your progress. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1614770806575321089))
    
###### ID 457634235

> 1.) Consulting
> 2.) Sponsorship
> 3.) Digital product
> This gives you a diversified, resilient business!
> You'll simultaneously be growing across your newsletter AND social.
> And as your audience grows, so will your revenue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayclouse/status/1614770807871344640))
