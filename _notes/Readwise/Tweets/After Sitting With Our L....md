## Highlights
###### ID 667479930
> After sitting with our legal team to parse through the fine print of Apple's DMA announcement (that took a while), which is, at best vague and misleading, I wanted to share my thoughts.  
> While Apple has behaved badly for years, what they did yesterday represents a new low, even for them. See more info here: https://t.co/2lznqwYujY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988499518362089))
    
###### ID 667479931
> For almost five years – 1,782 days – we have been asking the European Commission to take action against Apple. You can imagine my excitement when the DMA was created and passed into law because it was such a progressive step against Apple’s App Store monopoly.

###### ID 667479932
> But of course, I was skeptical of Apple’s intentions to comply after years of watching them get away with such extreme abuse with all the ways they skirt regulations around the world. Who wouldn’t be? But the law is the law, right? Not if you are Apple… ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988503348043963))
    
###### ID 667479933
> Sadly this is a classic move of an old, dominant company that believes the rules don’t apply to them. Instead of adapting and innovating, they're twisting the situation, making it seem like the regulators are at fault. Or even worse, pretending this has to do with security when it’s clearly a ploy to drive their own profits. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988505507856405))
    
###### ID 667479934
> Their reaction to the DMA is a masterclass in distortion. They present a 'simple' choice: Stick with their current terms or switch to a convoluted new model that looks attractive on the surface but has potentially even higher fees. Reality check: Apple's alternative is no alternative at all for some of the world’s most popular apps. It just repackages the old terms and the 30% IAP they want to protect.

###### ID 667479935
> In Apple's 'new' world, the fees could be astronomical. Picture this: A popular free app with tens or hundreds of millions EU users, now faces a tax on every download and update annually. Imagine the impact on popular apps like WhatsApp, Duolingo, X, and Pinterest, all free to users, but now potentially incurring fees to the tune of tens to hundreds of millions of €. Essentially this means they cannot accept being on alternative App stores. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988509798596693))
    
###### ID 667479936
> Without the presence of many major apps, alternative app stores will lack appeal, rendering the EU's efforts to foster digital market competition futile. Apple's message is clear: disrupt their toll-booth operation, and they'll ensure you regret it. This isn't just about fees; it's a warning – don't resist, just comply. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988512176869573))
    
###### ID 667479937
> Spotify itself faces an untenable situation. With our EU Apple install base in the 100 million range, this new tax on downloads and updates could skyrocket our customer acquisition costs, potentially increasing them tenfold. This as we have to pay on every install or update to our free or paid app, even for those who no longer use the service. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988514106233049))
    
###### ID 667479938
> So where does that leave us? Under the new terms, we cannot afford these fees if we want to be a profitable company, so our only option is to stick with the status quo. The very thing we’ve been fighting against for five years. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988516656591164))
    
###### ID 667479939
> I think it’s important to say that Apple's design ethos and products have my admiration. But this is just hostile. It's not the Apple that once pushed the boundaries of technology and design. This is a company resting, not breaking any new ground, and turning its back on the principles that once made it the shining example of innovation. And it’s certainly not in compliance with the DMA. It’s a monopoly under a different mask. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988518585696632))
    
###### ID 667479940
> By inventing a new tax system to replace the old, Apple mocks the spirit of the law and the lawmakers who wrote it. I sincerely hope the EU recognizes this for exactly what it is and stands firm, and doesn’t let their work over the years all be for nothing. The world is watching.
