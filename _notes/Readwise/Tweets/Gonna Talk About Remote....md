## Highlights
###### ID 446003209
> Gonna talk about Remote Work and its Consequences a bit. I've been thinking about its relationship to urban power and prestige. Remote work is creating a feedback loop that is going to erode a significant degree of urban power. Hear me out:

> https://t.co/BZb8oea00G
> One of the most powerful pseudo-factions in the US is what we'll call "Urban Interests". The combined cultural and economic power centralized around a few coastal cities and some outliers such as Chicago, with dwarf examples like SLC or Austin. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983803405697028))
    
###### ID 446003213
> No generation has fell victim to this siren song as bad as Millennials. Our entire generation can largely be defined by people hyping up prepackaged "lifestyles" that are meant to signal degrees of success or failure. Signaling that opens doors to other opportunities. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983805532188672))
    
###### ID 446003215
> I think this signaling and its consequences have incentivized a lot of our political partisanship and problems we experience currently. Certain types of people are willing to pay out the nose for the big shitty lifestyle and prestige.

###### ID 446003217
> The heartland has been engaging in a generations long ritual of child sacrifice to the cities for quite some time now. Strivers of all kinds flee "flyover country" for the big city. The prestige and bragging rights of living and working in these places often is cope. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983809369964544))
    
###### ID 446003219
> The high paying and prestigious jobs are in these places. That economic opportunity draws large quantities of the best human capital in the country, and the overpopulation as a result drives extremely high prices for the luxury of "the lifestyle". ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983810993192960))
    
###### ID 446003221
> The average @coldhealing product manager or intern video at a FAANG or fortune 500 is living paycheck to paycheck, often severely overleveraged on debt. Without the prestige, these people wouldn't be so quick to tolerate the economic conditions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983812830269440))
    
###### ID 446003223
> The problem is, the largest companies that offer the prestigious jobs are the *most* vulnerable to remote outsourcing of talent that can live literally anywhere. These careers are very heavily bureaucratic or administratively based. All keystrokes and no swinging a hammer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983814440878082))
    
###### ID 446003225
> You don't have to offer cost of living adjusted salaries to these employees, and as someone involved in the hiring process, I can see myself how much people covet the 100% remote job.
> The employees wanna do it, the companies have incentives. It's the cities who lose everything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983816227663872))
    
###### ID 446003227
> These cities have sprawling infrastructure that is expensive to maintain, and a large exodus of some of their most beneficial tax base isn't good for them. And examples like the Intelligencer article on turning skyscrapers into apartment complexes has 2nd order impacts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983817947328513))
    
###### ID 446003229
> As any lefty in California will retort when you talk about how expensive it is there, the answer is more high density housing, right?
> Well a big part of the cultural prestige comes from these high costs. "making it" in NYC or San Fran has prestige of its own to these people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983819692167170))
    
###### ID 446003231
> Being able to portray some vivid utopian lifestyle in these highly expensive areas implies you're economically prosperous, even if you're paycheck to paycheck and overleveraged with student loans, living in a closet sized loft. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983821432815618))
    
###### ID 446003233
> All of this comes together to create something of an "industrial urban complex" and an incestuous brain trust of the professional managerial class in these places. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983823152480257))
    
###### ID 446003235
> This results in the people who seek this prestige working at the companies who exert the most influence, and then we wonder why exactly it is that soyboys and middle class AWFL's exert so much cultural and institutional power? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983824813404160))
    
###### ID 446003237
> Remote work is going to edge away a lot of the market share of these companies, because it's good for the companies as well as the remote employees.
> In the process, that real estate will get converted and balance itself around the new dynamic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983826562445312))
    
###### ID 446003239
> More remote workers = less demand on urban housing
> More remote workers = less demand on commercial real estate
> Converting commercial real estate into high density residential = lower prices
> And this all means lower tax revenue for decaying urban infrastructure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983828743458817))
    
###### ID 446003241
> When you consider the overall power of silicon valley and hollywood, you need to consider that the overall power of the Urban Industrial Complex is a degree of the power behind those institutions themselves. If it is diminished, so are they. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983831289421824))
    
###### ID 446003244
> I'm just shooting from the hip and musing a bit here, but it's worth spinning your wheels a bit on. Entropy and spreading out the people who work these middle class jobs across cheaper places will have an impact too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983833004871680))
    
###### ID 446003246
> They might gather in their snobbery in places like Helena, Boise, SLC, etc, but time will tell if they can do so in hostile territory to a degree that can turn those states purple, and not all of them are hostile to begin with. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983834716143619))
    
###### ID 446003248
> This could also revitalize some of heartland america with a new tax base and consumer demand above the usual decaying economy of a dollar tree, dairy queen, and a bunch of government workers/retirees.
> Worth thinking about. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608983836200927236))
    
###### ID 446003250
> Of course most of these people will settle for cities in red states, because they aren't going to want to homestead.
> But it's going to dilute coastal influence, we just need to keep it from being a cancer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1608984342306648065))
    
###### ID 446003252
> Also of note is that this opens up a form of freedom of association. I've been remote for 4 years, but I can move to a town that has favorable demographics and lots of families ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609001236950302728))
    
###### ID 446003254
> @OliverCash9 What I do is very customer facing, and frankly, nobody wants to talk to foreign people with a poor grasp of english and a call center script in my line of work. It's why my industry doesn't outsource often. (IT support/consulting for small and midsize biz) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609062911477157889))
    
###### ID 446003256
> @OliverCash9 The guys in Manila are great though. Good handle on English and a good attitude. They cover after-hours work in the states due to the time zone difference, as well as some of our international clients in Australia. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609063114133196808))
    
###### ID 446003257
> States are already competing in terms of policy to attract these people btw. West Virginia is offering 12k cash and a total relocation package valued at 20k to attract remote workers to a state that has a low cost of living and low priced land.

###### ID 446003258
> https://t.co/vDsol8fTXQ Lets not forget the death loop this can also cause the cities, as the populations that cause most of the crime and drain the most tax money for public services will account for almost none of these outflows.
> If they have a job at all it's not a remote one ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609075265715544065))
    
###### ID 446003259
> The people on public assistance aren't going to suddenly pack up and move or look for work in these smaller economies, and the homeless on the west coast where it doesn't freeze in the winter aren't going to catch a greyhound so they can leave needles on the streets of Omaha. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609075589293670401))
    
###### ID 446003260
> All the parasites and millstones around the neck of these large cities have no incentive to leave.
> Let the crackheads have San Francisco, the Chinese investors parking their USD in bay area real estate can pay for the rescue mission because I sure won't. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609076381429780481))
    
###### ID 446003261
> https://t.co/aohp3yr7tz
> And the irony is when I've argued with DNC staffers in CA about the problem of rent and real estate, their answer is always "WELL WE NEED HIGH DENSITY HOUSING"
> But they always have this vibe, where this isn't what they had in mind. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609080412201967616))
    
###### ID 446003262
> What they had in mind always seems to amount to rezoning things so they can put section 8 apartment buildings in front of suburban subdivisions. I imagine it's just as much about acting punitively as it is "increasing the supply of housing" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Aristos_Revenge/status/1609080414051893250))
