> If this doesn't blow your mind, idk what will ðŸ¤¯
> DATA is your own personal Jarvis with a 1-tap install
> Replaces Siri with ChatGPT
> Remembers everything you tell it
> Across all your devices
> And it's free to try
> https://t.co/WAzV64ILvP is our AI project to make computing feel more human
> @LanderMedia
> Here are the 4 best demo videos of the magic of DATA in action.
> DATA is a personalized assistant that knows and remembers every conversation you have with it across your:
> Phone
> Laptop
> Tablet
> Watch
> Texts
> Emails
> and smart speakers!
> You can talk to DATA right in your headphones or text it just like a person.
> DATA can read, write, understand, speak any language, and translate between them.
> It can help with real work and home-life tasks like research, writing, scheduling, reminders, and email triage.
> And it's easily customizable so you can have DATA automatically do whatever you want whenever you want with just a few taps and natural language instructions - no code required.
> DATA can do just about anything you can do on your phone on your behalf automatically including very advanced things Siri can't, like:
> Summarizing
> Analyzing
> Drafting replies
> And writing documents.
> It can read web pages, texts or emails you show it, or PDFs of any kind.
> It can do other real-world tasks that require complex analysis and common sense too, like:
> - figure out where the nearest beach is (even when you're in Colorado) and instantly fetch the current surf report up to the current minute.
> - summarize and draft replies to entire email chains
> - plan out entire work projects or multi-day vacations on your calendar
> - sketch out ideas for you in picture form or draft Notion pages with charts and graphs.
> DATA can also use its own judgment to determine when to run an action or not, even if you've scheduled it, allowing you to make VERY complex automations that require many different inputs to make a decision, like for example:
> - only opening the blinds on your lunch break if it's sunny out and you're working from home.
> DATA works natively and easily with Apple HomeKit & other shortcuts.
> DATA can also take initiative and check in with you throughout the day by voice or text and proactively send messages to you and others on your behalf based on your personal and professional goals, current tasks, and calendar.
> DATA can integrate with many apps on your phone and is compatible with multiple large AI language models.
> Here's the complete breakdown â€”
> The no-code iOS shortcut suite called DATA.
> VS.
> The new recently released ChatGPT OpenAI Official iPhone app with plugins, browsing, and code interpreter.
> ChatGPT App:
> - GPT-3 or 4
> - Can use plugins if you resume from a previous conversation in history
> - Searchable history synced across devices
> - Cool haptics (can turn off in settings if you're boring)
> - Free, or $20 for the same features but slightly smarter. No trial, no customer support, no refunds.
> vs.
> DATA:
> - All of the above
> - Just one "Activate DATA" button to do anything with AI, no commands to remember or plugins to figure out. Just talk to it like a person.
> - Plus location, time, personal and work calendar, weather forecast awareness, as well as an up-to-date view of your current short and long-term goals.
> - Persistent memory of *all* conversations on all devices, not just the current one
> - Don't have to use tricks to use plugins, just ask or it will decide when it is appropriate to use a plugin without you reminding it that it can ðŸ˜‚
> - One app icon to do anything with AI: type, talk, read, or listen.
> - show it or generate pictures
> - do research online or draft PDFs
> - Can run JS & Python code interpreter natively on your phone.
> - Can edit & draft spreadsheets & other documents, too, even fancy excel formulas.
> - Can run multiple instances or run in the background or on your headphones, watches, HomePods, or macs.
> - Will even auto-reply to texts & emails you get with your exact guidelines.
> - Can be scheduled, automated, and customized to your hearts desire fully open source.
> - Automated email & iMessage replies, set up in 5 minutes (with blue bubbles!)
> - Set up in as little as 5 minutes if you're not technical. Just works.
> - No google or microsoft account needed. Also no logging in every time lol
> - Lifetime access is available if you hate subscriptions, real human customer support, and crazy 4.5 month satisfaction guarantee.
> - Plus a growing community of AI builders supporting each other and building amazing shortcuts and income streams.
> - Anything you use your phone or laptop for, from ordering Starbucks to actually getting work done, can now be done with one tap. 
> - You don't even have to remember how to use it or worry about fancy prompting, just ask like you'd ask a person. DATA will get it done.
> I've gotten to make a few demo videos that I think really capture how powerful DATA can be for everyday life.
> Here they are all in one tweet. Make sure your sound is on as you watch them.
> 1. This is the first demo video I ever made from April 19th, 2023. It walks through all the ways you can interact with and use the DATA shortcuts. Everything from saying "Hey Siri" to tapping on custom apps on your home screen.
> 2. The second demo video was made on May 5 and is an example use case I made of how commands work - commands allow DATA to actually run actions on your phone like taking pictures and sending messages.
> This demo shows me taking a picture of an email template, and data drafting an email based on that template.
> It's gotten much better at realizing when it has just run a command and incorporating that information naturally into the conversation now, especially on GPT-4.
> 3. This third Commands video, May 12 is a walkthrough of ALL the phone functions that commands allow DATA to do:
> Sending texts and emails, taking pictures, seeing pictures, reading things, and scheduling events.
> Since this video we've added auto-replies to texts and emails, summarizing documents, writing documents, health app data retrieval, web surfing, scheduling alarms, making playlists, and more.
> 4. This last demo I made today, June 15, shows everything DATA does working in concert:
> The best morning briefing on earth.
> It will generate a crazy detailed morning briefing with background music - including making a unique playlist and giving a detailed analysis of current events complete with Ski & Surf conditions near me and 40 other live searches to pull live information from the internet.
> 15 minutes of setup after your 1-tap install and DATA will know who you are and how best to serve you.
> What would you use DATA for?
