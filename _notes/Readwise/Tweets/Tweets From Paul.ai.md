> Many people complain about ChatGPT's results.
> But you have to write the right prompt to get a good answer.
> I show you the perfect ChatGPT Prompt formula in just a few steps ↓
> 1. Task
> Begin with an action verb, specifying the desired output.
> E.g.: Generate a table with fruits to eat in summer.
> 2. Context
> Offer just enough relevant information by addressing background, success criteria, and environment.
> E.g.: I'm a content creator talking about artificial intelligence on Twitter/𝕏."
> 3. Exemplars
> Including examples or frameworks within the prompt enhances output quality.
> E.g.: (Task) Give me design ideas for my website with an object, a color, an action and a style. For example: "A blue robot sitting on a chair in a futuristic style".
> 4. Persona
> Define who you want the AI to emulate, considering their expertise and role.
> E.g.: You're a recruiter who's been working in human resources for 20 years.
> 5. Format
> Visualize the desired output format, which can be paragraphs, bullet points, emails, etc.
> E.g.: Give your answer in the form of a table with 3 columns: "Type of task", "Ease", "Degree of urgency".
> 6. Tone
> Communicate the desired tone, style, or mood for the AI's response.
> E.g. "Use a formal, professional tone to give your answer". ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/itsPaulAi/status/1698718054895554783))
