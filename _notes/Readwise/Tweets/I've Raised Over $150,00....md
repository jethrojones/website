## Highlights
###### ID 240513409

> Here's how to get VC's to throw money at you: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942285995151360))
    
###### ID 240513410
> A big mistake founders make is thinking that the purpose of a deck is to get people to invest. 
> The truth is that whoever is reading your deck is likely distracted/not interested. Your job is to stand out, and make them excited. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942287849017348))
    
###### ID 240513411
> Figure out ways to communicate things in very simple ways - it could be through simple language, numbers, clear visualization elements, or being creative in your presentation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942289698721792))
    
###### ID 240513412
> 1. Having a good framing of the problem is key. Assume that the investor you're pitching to knows next to nothing about the industry or problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942291598737412))
    
###### ID 240513413
> Effective framing helps the investor understand the problem and why your solution is important. It also helps them empathize with the user experience ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942293377126402))
    
###### ID 240513414
> 2. Find ways to present yourself as the expert who can solve the problem.
> Having a strong resume that sets up your credibility is very important.
> The 'team' slide is often the one that interests me the most in setting up a meeting and finding out more ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942295168012291))
    
###### ID 240513415
> Good investors will invest in founders, not companies. 
> If you're creating a creator-focused company, it helps if you are an expert, or content creator yourself.
> If you are building a deep AI company, maybe you spent years at Google or Nvidia ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942296959062022))
    
###### ID 240513416
> In the countless decks I've seen, too often there are terrible team slides with names next to random logos/affiliations that have little to no relevance.
> Use specific bullet p oints for each person and why they are important and qualified to work on this idea. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942298804482048))
    
###### ID 240513417
> 3. What's your solution? No, really...what is it?
> As someone who is viewing your deck (and thousands of others), I should not have to work very hard to understand your solution. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942300641656835))
    
###### ID 240513418
> Don't just include random screenshots of the UI without any context - this is a common theme.
> Instead, walk people through user journeys like value propositions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942302466162694))
    
###### ID 240513419
> If you can't sum up your killer app in 1 - 3 bullet points, then it probably doesn't have killer features driving it.
> Simplicity is your friend. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942304382947331))
    
###### ID 240513420
> User stories are also very compelling. If I had to pitch @Uber, the narrative about the difficulties of hailing a taxi in the city versus the ease of the app -> destination is simple and compelling.
> (not sponsored by Uber [yet]) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942306161344517))
    
###### ID 240513421
> 4. Traction
> This is important because its the number one signifier that people are interested in your product. Even if they aren't users, it still means they are at least curious. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942308027826177))
    
###### ID 240513422
> Ideal metrics to include are the ones that require the least explanation as possible to the investor, and ones which honestly depict relevant growth data. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942309802020867))
    
###### ID 240513423
> 5. Vision
> Pitch the biggest vision that you can for your solution.
> 'Here's why this is going to change the world.'
> This gets investors interested, intrigued, and understanding of the direction you're heading. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942311597162498))
    
###### ID 240513424
> I encourage everyone to put something in about what the world looks like in which your idea is successful.
> However, your vision slide has to be credible. If you want to topple Apple or Google, your team needs to be credible enough to do it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942313358716929))
    
###### ID 240513425
> End your pitch with your vision once you have enough social currency with the potential investor.
> I need to believe what you're saying, which is established through understanding the problem, being shown the solution, and convinced that this is going to work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942315262930944))
    
###### ID 240513426
> Extra notes;
> Design is important. Your deck doesn't have to be fancy, but it can't look terrible (trust me, I've seen some pretty horrible ones that are an instant turnoff).
> Appearance inspires confidence - avoid looking sloppy! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1450942317049749513))
