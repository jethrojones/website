> Each week she creates a menu and texts it to my wife and I. Sometimes we request adjustments based on what we're feeling. 
> She buys the groceries on our behalf and bill us later.
> After cooking, all dishes are in the fridge with labels. The kitchen is left spotless. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marshal/status/1693969759308484821))
    
###### ID 584656191
> Our spending on eating out has gone down because of this, so the total cost of hiring a chef is netting out to be a bit cheaper than I originally expected.
> We no longer have to think about what's for dinner. There's always something healthy and delicious for us in the fridge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marshal/status/1693969760570974503))

> Our chef does this for 5 other families (1 on each day of the week). 
> To find her, I used Google, Yelp, and local Facebook Groups. I narrowed it down to 3 candidates. 
> Ultimately I found ours via a neighborhood FB group. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/marshal/status/1693969761720308077))
