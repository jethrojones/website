> I hear this shit all the time:
> "I want to start a website, but I don't know where to begin."
> "I don't know where I need to focus on my online business."
> Everyone, including myself, struggles with the same thing.
> And... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903259051720708))

> Last week, I got an email asking if I could write an article on brewing hazy beers.
> So I decided to sit down and commit to writing everything I know from 4 years of brewing nothing but hazy IPAs. 
> And this shit took me three days to complete!

> Was it a waste of time to create content for 1 subscriber? Abso-fucking-lutely not!
> That article lives on my site forever! I sent an email to my list, added it to my newsletter, and created a video.
> I'll repeat all that again in 3-4 months.
> Here's my point... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903263535431682))
    
###### ID 310069222
> I don't have a business without articles, videos, emails, and even social media posts. I just have a domain name, a hosting account, and products that don't sell.
> Content makes everything easier. It makes selling easier. It makes life easier. 
> It's the lifeblood of my company. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903264718213124))
    
###### ID 310069223
> You might be thinking, "Matt, I have a website, a product, a little traffic, but I wanna supercharge my sales with paid ads! How do I do that?"
> You do that with content!
> Case in point... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903265842274309))

> You can pay for an ad during the Super Bowl. But if your ad sucks butt, you wasted 6.5 million dollars on a 30-second piece of shit.
> Content marketing is accessible to everyone. Anyone can do it. But it's hard as fuck. I love making videos & articles, but I will admit it's hard. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903266949570561))
    
###### ID 310069225
> But I'm glad I'm writing this. I'm creating content. I'm Tweeting it. 
> Maybe you will read it and find value. Or at the very least, it kicks you in the ass to make some fucking content today. 
> Either way, I'm putting something out there. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903268077858820))
    
###### ID 310069226
> Every time I put something out into the world, it's another chance for an email subscriber, a customer, or a share (which leads to more subscribers and customers). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903269210251266))
    
###### ID 310069227
> But if I didn't write this, and instead, sat at my desk watching a video on how to write better tweets (because that's me just procrastinating), then I'm the loser. 
> As a result, my business stagnates and I start asking myself the same questions at the beginning of this tweet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903270330191872))
    
###### ID 310069228
> So if you're asking yourself, "what should I do today?" Or, "what should I focus on this week?" 
> The answer is always CREATE SOME FUCKING CONTENT! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903271546564608))
    
###### ID 310069229
> If you keep doing that consistently, everything in your business will get easier and become effortless. 
> You'll cure your shiny object syndrome, and running a website will lot more fun!
> End of ðŸ§µ. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MattGiovanisci/status/1513903272620298242))
