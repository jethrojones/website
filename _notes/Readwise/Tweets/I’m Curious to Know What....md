## Highlights

> I’m curious to know what in the Bible convinced our friend here that Joseph Smith’s interpretations of the Bible were incorrect?
> I have read the Bible and Book of Mormon many times cover to cover, and many other texts of religions throughout history, and I have never found anything in any other religious text that would infer that Joseph’s interpretations of the Bible were incorrect.
> What’s even more amazing is what you see when you take every religion and every history and put them all on the world stage together, instead of trying to put a single religion under the microscope. You not only confirm that the Restoration had to happen, but you discover there have been many True religions throughout history, in a cyclical pattern of formation (or restoration), a period of prosperity, then corruption, and eventually apostasy and a period of subsequent darkness.
> What follows is evidence-based conjecture based on my own research.
> The modern Christian generally only recognizes the religion that came through the Abrahamic line as the “true” religion, but Christ said He had other sheep who were not of that fold (the Jews), and we know that He even told the Nephites when He visited them that He had yet other sheep. 
> And there accounts of Jesus visiting Japan (in the village of Shingo in Aomori Prefecture), India (the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community hold this belief), and even Great Britain (from Glastonbury). I’m sure there are more. 
> Having studied every major religion in world history, I believe that Hinduism and Zoroastrianism were also “True” religions revealed by God for those nations (recognizing “Hinduism” was pieced together from fragmented records of the ancient Indus Valley civilization). 
> When you read those texts, they parallel the teachings of the Bible and Book of Mormon and give a clear picture of the patterns of God’s true religion. None of their teachings conflict with each other. They all essentially try to bring their respective unique cultures into a harmonious alignment with their Supreme Deity. They teach love and charity and all of the same core values as Christianity. 
> And of course, add the religion of Adam, the religion of Enoch, the religion of Abraham, the religion of Moses, and the religion of Solomon, how many do we have? Seven. Seven “True” religions before Christ came.
> No coincidences.
> Now, those were all religions of men, given to a crude world out of a desire to make the world a better place. And each one only had limited keys and authority.
> But when Christ came, He then established His Church, which represents a synthesis of all seven religions that came before, and held every key and every authority. But Christ prophesied that His Church would also undergo the same falling away as those religions before.
> Now here’s what the naysayers against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints don’t understand. The Bible actually does necessitate a Restoration, just not directly stated. For Christ said ravenous wolves would come in, which would imply that the kingdom would become corrupt.
> But at the Second Coming, we are told that Christ will present the kingdom to His Father.
> “Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.” (1 Corinthians 15:24).
> How can Christ present a corrupted kingdom to His Father? He can’t.
> But here we further see the wisdom of God. For in each dispensation (which is the period of a religion’s tenure and subsequent darkness, aka a day and a night), the religion of light existed alongside a polytheistic religion of Satan. 
> Satan didn’t understand that the true religion was monotheistic, and so he presented his polytheistic counterfeit in each dispensation and treated the contrary monotheistic religions as his enemy. Not recognizing these small zealot groups as truly being of God (that Satan doesn’t believe actually exists as a real entity but rather as an impossible idea), but as simply fools with dumb ideas (sound familiar?), he sought to destroy them so they would have no influence over his dominion. I can imagine he just considered those glitches in the Matrix that needed to be snuffed out. There is truth in all things. 
> But the Great Apostasy was a special period where the entire dispensation did not receive a Restoration, with the Priesthood hid up and preserved by John the Revelator. And so there was no religion of God that arose during that time.
> I have traced the Great Apostasy to sometime in the 2nd century AD to the 12th century AD. During this time, I have been unable to find any new revelations given, and all the texts we have are basically regurgitations or analyses of previous teachings. 
> And it was also during this time that the “Church” exerted a great and abominable influence over the world. It is clear to all that the True Church was not on the Earth anywhere in that period, and what stood in its place was an abomination to God. And the Church and Crowns tarnished the reputation of Christianity so horribly during that period that there are many today who will never choose to believe because of this dark time in world history. 
> “But wait,” you might say, “Islam arose during that time and is monotheistic.”
> Ah, yes. But did you already forget that Satan is the Great Counterfeiter?
> While it is true he doesn’t believe God exists as a physical entity, he absolutely took note of this “prophet” that he foolishly had murdered, who had some great power he couldn’t comprehend, and was able to tear away many of the souls he had taken captive. 
> What would you do?
> He then took this “monotheistic” idea more seriously. And he saw the great power it had over souls. 
> And he wants to have all the power. So he must reverse engineer whatever he has seen that he didn’t know about before and try to reengineer it for himself. Remember, he seeks to exalt himself above the stars, as it is written!
> And so, instead of a polytheistic religion—which had great dominion over the pre-Christ world—Satan counterfeited Christianity. And that is what Islam is.
> Notice that Islam only considers Christ a “prophet,” because that’s all Satan knows for sure he was, because he cannot ever actually admit that He was truly the Son of God, but was rather delusional (sound familiar?).
> And here’s the kicker. Satan needed to destroy all evidence of this other religion that he discovered had such great power. He always lives in fear that somebody more powerful might come along and take even more of his dominion away.
> He controlled Christianity, and he also controlled Islam. But those darned pesky “records” that kept popping up and leading to these “restorations” could be a thorn in his side. 
> Whelp. 
> Let’s just make these two great religions that a vast majority of the world belongs to, and let’s have them go to war with each other! And while they’re at it, let’s go ahead and conveniently destroy every single record we can find. Boom. 
> Oh, and by the way, Satan felt he had his entire dominion back. Why do I say this? First off, Christ left with all the Saints. They were gone. And guess what? When he established his counterfeit, Islam, there was no small group of rogue zealots that arose that followed a monotheistic religion that he had to squash this time. 
> So, he could be free to do everything to his heart’s desire. But God let him do it for the same reason He allowed Satan into the Garden in the first place: TO EXPOSE HIM.
> At this point in history, we can look back and clearly see how evil that entire period was. Everyone sought war. Nobody sought peace. It was all about conquest on both sides, and there was little value for life. Massive armies would slaughter the innocent, and there was no refuge for the meek. 
> It was the era of kill or be killed. 
> But then in the 12th century AD, something amazing happened. People started receiving amazing revelations. You had the prophetess Hildegard von Bingen shown the visions of SCIVIAS. And oh, boy, if you have not read that and want to know more about Satan and the last days, including the Beast and Antichrist, that’s the one for you.
