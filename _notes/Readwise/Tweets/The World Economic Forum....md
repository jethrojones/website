## Highlights
###### ID 457136571
> The World Economic Forum's Davos summit starts tomorrow. Its founder, Klaus Schwab, is one of the most influential men alive. He even participated in the G-20 summit of world leaders last November. 
> Why is that? And who, exactly, is Klaus Schwab?

> The World Economic Forum is fighting back against those who say it and its founder are seeking global domination through a “great reset” aimed at stripping the masses of their private property, de-industrializing the economy, and making everybody eat bugs.

> “‘Own nothing, be happy’ — you might have heard the phrase,” wrote a WEF spokesperson last August. “It started life as a screenshot, culled from the Internet by an anonymous anti-semitic account on the image board 4chan. ‘Own nothing, be happy – The Jew World Order 2030’..." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1614782344938016768))

> But what WEF's spokesperson claimed was inaccurate. 
> The phrase, “Own nothing, be happy,” hadn’t originated on 4chan; it originated on WEF’s own website. 
> “Welcome to 2030,” read the article by a Danish MP, “I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better.”

###### ID 457136575
> But WEF can hardly be said to be a conspiracy. Davos is one of the most heavily publicized events in the world. Every conference, including this year’s, results in hundreds of articles about the world leaders, celebrities, and billionaires who attend the conference. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1614782833935126529))
    
###### ID 457136576
> This year’s 700-plus attendees will include heads of state, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and CEOs, including Larry Fink from Blackrock. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1614782884552019968))
    
###### ID 457136577
> But WEF has proven to be highly secretive, even as it urges corporations to disclose more infor. When Public asked WEF how Klaus Schwab Foundation invests its assets, a spokesperson told us, “Swiss law does not require financial reporting for foundations.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1614783021823188992))
    
###### ID 457136578
> WEF says its wealth is managed by an internal Investment Committee that seeks to incorporate “environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in its investment strategy to manage the foundation’s long-term strategic reserves.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1614783068786806788))
    
###### ID 457136579
> Still, WEF doesn’t engage in even the minimal amount of transparency through public disclosure that it constantly preaches to corporations and philanthropies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1614783166564425731))
    
###### ID 457136580
> WEF’s 2021 annual report also touts a relationship with an unnamed hedge fund and a portfolio of assets that includes Swiss equities, Swiss bonds, global equities, and precious metals that is in part managed by Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1614783210424274945))

> Meanwhile, Schwab has become, without question, one of the most influential men alive. 
> It wasn’t the head of Aspen Institute or even the Secretary-General of the United that was hobnobbing with G-20 world leaders in Indonesia last November.

> It was Schwab. Photos and videos from the event show Schwab palling around with the Prime Ministers of Britain, Canada, and New Zealand.
> Why is that? What, exactly, are Schwab and WEF up to, and why?
> Read the scoop from @izakaminska & me at Public!
