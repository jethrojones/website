> 99% of it is making a few big decisions well (like what business to go after) and then having the courage and confidence to get uncomfortable.
> The truth about this world is that every single thing worth having requires a level of uncomfort to get. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1737837891831857549))
    
###### ID 645742146
> It is uncomfortable to step into the arena and go after that job you aren’t qualified for. 
> It is uncomfortable to walk up to the prettiest girl at the bar and introduce yourself.
> It is uncomfortable to take the risk to start a business. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1737837893962658103))
    
###### ID 645742147
> Making that big real estate deal is scary as hell. 
> Making your first hire is also scary. 
> Firing that first employee is even harder. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1737837895463944462))
    
###### ID 645742148
> Avoiding uncomfortable situations is natural. 
> But going to great lengths to avoid uncomfort is a sure fire way to be waking up 10 years from now in the same situation that you’re in right now. 
> No growth. 
> No additional success. 
> Nothing to hang your hat on. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1737837896684671481))
    
###### ID 645742149
> Remember that stress is relative. 
> For somebody living a soft, easy life, even the smallest thing, like a flat tire on the side of the road, can shake up their entire day.
> On the other hand a seasoned, successful, level headed individual who has grown comfortable with the uncertainty and volatility of life might forget to even mention the flat tire at dinner that night. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1737837898723209279))
    
###### ID 645742150
> Handling uncomfortable situations is a trained skill. 
> The more uncomfort we face, the better we get at making cool, calm, effective decisions in those environments.
> The more comfortable we get in those uncomfortable situations, the more we can accomplish overall. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1737837900732248229))
    
###### ID 645742151
> Want to be successful? 
> Check your insecurity at the door. 
> Put yourself out there. 
> Muster up some confidence to look like an idiot and not give a crap what other people think.
> Get uncomfortable. 
> Then watch your world open up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1737837902644879627))
