###### ID 477130702
> For context, we sell two premium @NotionHQ templates:
> - Creator's Companion (launched Aug. 2021) - complete planning/project management system for YouTubers and content creators
> - Ultimate Brain (launched April 2022) - all-in-one producitivity system w/ notes, takes, etc.

###### ID 477130703
> Creator's Companion also has multiple editions - a Base edition, Ultimate Tasks edition, and a bundle edition with Ultimate Brain.
> Revenue breakdown:
> - Ultimate Brain: $760k
> - Creator's Companion/Ultimate Brain bundle: $298k
> - CC Ultimate Tasks: $86k
> - CC Base: $17k ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711721323556865))
    
###### ID 477130704
> One finding I can share right now:
> Bundling works.
> The Creator's Companion/Ultimate Brain bundle outsells the other editions by a 3:1 ratio, and results in much higher average order value.
> You can see all the templates here: https://t.co/sCgLq46GKB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711723944972289))

> I broke down my exact strategies for audience-building, marketing the templates, and optimizing the sales pages here:

###### ID 477130706
> To show how those template sales fit into the overall business, here's a breakdown of all our income sources for 2022.
> I personally like seeing expenses and profit in breakdowns like this, so I'm also including those as well with the top expense categories highlighted.

###### ID 477130707
> I also want to share what I find to be the most interesting chart - our gross and net income over the last 6 years.
> - 2018's big jump came from signing with @WatchNebula Talent and getting a sponsor on every video
> - 2019's jump came from launching my @skillshare class 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FoUHuywacAITihE.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711749563781120))
    
###### ID 477130708
> Interestingly, our revenue growth from 2019-2021 was relatively small.
> My sponsor rates grew steadily each year, and I released classes, but we didn't do anything that really moved the needle in those years.
> (2020 has lower net revenue due camera/server investments) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711753535795201))
    
###### ID 477130709
> P.S. - if you're a creator and want to learn how to maximize your sponsorship income, I wrote a (stupidly long) thread on it:
> https://t.co/penH58n5St ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711756127879168))
    
###### ID 477130710
> It wasn't until I finally launched my own products and started promoting them that our revenue really jumped up.
> Even more interestingly, I didn't promote these products on my main channel AT ALL.
> In fact, I haven't published a video on that channel in nearly a year. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FoUHvw4agAEe9a8.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711765774774273))
    
###### ID 477130711
> This means that we effectively doubled our revenue by going all-in on a much smaller niche channel.
> Proof that More Views =/= More Money.
> If you can niche down and become the go-to resource for a specific audience, that can be far more powerful than 10x higher views. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711769985863680))
    
###### ID 477130712
> This focus also necessarily meant neglecting other income sources (and my main channel).
> Our revenue from affiliates, sponsorships, Skillshare courses, etc all dropped compared to 2021.
> But the template revenue more than made up for those drops.

###### ID 477130714
> For additional context, here's the sub/view growth for 2022 for Thomas Frank Explains:
> - Subs: 43,000 to 110,000 (67,000 added)

###### ID 477130715
> Our top content during 2022:
> - Video going over Ultimate Brain (inspired by @Derek_Fitness' hyper-lengthy videos going over every ingredient in his pre-workout products)
> - @NotionHQ AI video
> - OLD task manager tutorial from 2020 (remaking that one soon)

###### ID 477130716
> I also continued focusing a lot on blogging.
> I try to create a written version of most Notion tutorials I do, since some people prefer to learn through text rather than video.
> Unfortunately I unwittingly broke my analytics in late November, so these stats are for Jan-Nov.

###### ID 477130717
> Some context on these stats:
> I've been creating content since 2010. I went full-time in 2012, made my first hire in 2016, and currently have a team of 8 people (including myself).
> This is a long-game business. If you're trying to do something similar, sticking it out is key. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711818128064512))
    
###### ID 477130718
> Here's a look at all the tools we use to run our Notion template business:
> - @lmsqueezy - checkout/delivery
> - @circleapp - support community
> - @ConvertKit - email marketing
> - @pipedream - automations
> - @testimonialto - testimonials
> - @FrontHQ - team email
> - @loom - screencasts ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711820741124096))
    
###### ID 477130719
> I've also spent years build a fast, optimized website that does well SEO-wise. That stack:
> CMS: @WordPress + @elemntor
> Host: @Vultr HF instance deployed through @gridpane
> Speed: Server-level Nginx page/Redis object cache, @Cloudflare, @FlyingPress_
> Monitoring: @uptimerobot ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711823350009858))
    
###### ID 477130721
> I'll note a few things:
> - We're running at scale, so some of these tools are expensive
> - I have two developers on staff
> - I know how to code
> You don't need to use these exact tools as a beginner. In fact, @thejustinwelsh makes more than I do with simpler tools. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711825967251457))
    
###### ID 477130722
> If you are a beginner and want a no-code approach, try these:
> Checkout: @lmsqueezy (easy to use and charges half what Gumroad does)
> Site: @NotionHQ + @NotakuHQ or @super_
> Email: @ConvertKit
> Automation: @make_hq (@pipedream is much more code-heavy, though cheaper) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711828605440000))
    
###### ID 477130724
> P.S. - we're working on a Notion resource detailing the features, fees, and Merchant of Record status of nearly every payment platform out there.
> It launches very soon and will be free; follow me if you don't want to miss it. 
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FoUHz9ZaEAAH-XP.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711839279943681))
    
###### ID 477130725
> Finally, strategy.
> My business strategy remains largely the same:
> - Establish an evergreen sales funnel (I don't really do launches or big sales pushes)
> - Get to stable income
> - Use income to subsidize the creation of free, epic resources ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711843692355585))
    
###### ID 477130726
> This has been my strategy since I hit $5k/mo in passive affiliate income back in 2012 via a massive WordPress tutorial.
> Instead of trying to grow that affiliate income through more WordPress tutorials, I used the income to build a library of content on academic success. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711846313791488))
    
###### ID 477130727
> I didn't want to make a paid course on how to get good grades. I wanted to make the best library of free content on how to do so that the world had ever seen.
> Hence using passive income as a subsidy.
> I'm leveraging that same strategy now as well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711848939446272))
    
###### ID 477130729
> Once we hit $100k/mo in template revenue and I was able to hire @balance_wtf to handle our customer support, our focus for the rest of 2022 went to free, yet massive content projects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711851539894272))
    
###### ID 477130730
> The first was my @NotionHQ formula guide - a complete, 42,000-word technical reference that covers every formula function.
> That took about 4 months of full-time effort to write, and it's completely free.
> https://t.co/tNBRGSX5XG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711854173929472))
    
###### ID 477130731
> After that, we started on a massive Notion API tutorial, which will finally launch this week.
> The video is over 2 hours, and the article version will likely crack 20,000 words.
> I'm well aware of alternative actions I could have taken to make FAR more money... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711856786964480))
    
###### ID 477130732
> ...but these are resources that I want to exist in the world.
> And from a strategy standpoint, I want to offer my audience a soup-to-nuts trove of answers on any possible Notion question they could have.
> I believe that leads to market mindshare, which leads to long-term profit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711859429380096))
    
###### ID 477130733
> I also believe money is a resource that should be used to gain knowledge and fund useful and interesting projects.
> That's all it is - a resource.
> Therefore, it shouldn't be maximized if it comes at the cost of stagnating your learning or abandoning helpful projects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711862050832385))
    
###### ID 477130734
> This year, we'll continue our push to publish as much useful free content as possible, inching closer to that comprehensive library of answers for anyone who wants to learn Notion.
> Additionally, I have a couple of other things I'm focused on, strategy-wise: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711864751984640))
    
###### ID 477130735
> First, I'm investing a significant amount of our revenue into a brand new project.
> I can't talk about it yet, but if you're a nerd like me... you're going to love it. Details coming soon.
> Second, I'm investing in experts who can help me up my game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711867360821248))
    
###### ID 477130736
> I recently invested in website/landing page roasts from @jayclouse and @helloitsolly, both of which were mega-helpful. HIghly recommended.
> I'm also continuing to seek out new friends who are also business owners. Iron sharpens iron. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1622711869994840064))
    
###### ID 477130737
> I want to wrap up by shouting out my amazing team. I couldn't do this without them, and I love working with them. Go follow them!
