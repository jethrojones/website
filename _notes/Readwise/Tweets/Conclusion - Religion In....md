> I've received some really good constructive feedback. Here are what I consider the 3 best:
> 1. I think I need to get a better handle on how many people take their cellphones to grocery stores and restaurants (that I can predict accurately), but leave them at home for worship. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Devin_G_Pope/status/1685026532002091009))
    
###### ID 684044148
> I thought outside of certain groups (e.g. Orthodox Jews), leaving your phone at home was uncommon, but I've been surprised by how many people have reached out to me claiming that it is regular practice for them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Devin_G_Pope/status/1685026534166257665))
    
###### ID 684044149
> 2. I'm not doing a very good job at measuring worship that takes place in rented or shared spaces. For example, if a congregation meets in a school building on the weekend, I'm not counting that worship. I need to figure out how important this is.

###### ID 684044150
> 3. I need to think more about how to measure worship that is occurring on non-primary worship days. For example, I've been told by *many* people that not counting visits to a Catholic church on Saturday nights is a huge mistake.

###### ID 684044151
> I think these three criticisms (among others) are super good and I am working on all three of them a bit right now and should address them or at least talk about them more in the soon-to-be-released paper. Thanks to everyone for your feedback! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Devin_G_Pope/status/1685026539560214528))
