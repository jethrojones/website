## Highlights

> Here is a periodic reminder that if you are a straight man in a professional setting, part of your job is having meals and meetings alone with individual women. This is about equity and fairness to your colleagues. Figure it out with your spouse/gf. There is a right answer here. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottew/status/1445570711678947335))

> "Avoid the appearance of evil." No. It is not evil. These are your colleagues, not prostitutes.
> "What if my neighbor sees me." Good. They will see you being normal and a professional. 
> "What if they falsely accuse me of something?" Stop it. Control your imagination. Be normal. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottew/status/1445571842996006913))

> "But my dad/religious leader told me it was never appropriate to be alone with a woman." It's okay to be wrong about stuff. Forgive them for harboring an old approach and chart your own course.
> "But I don't know if I can control myself." You can. You do every day in other ways. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottew/status/1445572540986920964))

> "But so-and-so ended up having an affair with their admin." Guess what, lunch didn't cause that. 
> "But I live thousands of miles from any colleague." Okay, you got me there buddy. Go in peace. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/scottew/status/1445573284439805955))
