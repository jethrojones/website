> A few days ago someone got in touch with me to promote their plugin.
> The plugin's called "Find a Freelancer" and it lets you find freelancers directly in ChatGPT.
> You can enter what services you are looking for and it will give you suggestions for freelancers to hire. https://t.co/A6m4tZrAmT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moritzkremb/status/1672959121715515397))
    
###### ID 554024191
> After some testing I realised that the suggested links are basically affiliate links.
> So this plugin is making money every time someone finds a freelancer and then hires them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moritzkremb/status/1672959125721067520))
    
###### ID 554024193
> Another plugin that does the same thing is "Lexi Shopper".
> Every time someone buys the recommended Amazon product, the plugin makes money. https://t.co/hz2WazS7Hj ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moritzkremb/status/1672959159288090625))
    
###### ID 554024195
> So how can you leverage this information to make money with plugins yourself?
> 1. Think of a plugin idea that users will want to use
> 2. With just 500+ plugins in the store, distribution is still relatively easy
> 3. Develop the plugin and monetize with affiliate links ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moritzkremb/status/1672959163318812673))
    
###### ID 554024197
> I want to create my own plugin now to test this out.
> I even found a partner who will help me build the plugin.
> (Will report back when I have some results) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/moritzkremb/status/1672959166141587457))

> If you're a solopreneur like me, it could help you open up an additional revenue channel.
