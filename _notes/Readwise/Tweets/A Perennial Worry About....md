> "A perennial worry about democracy: it produces unteachable, flat souls. Plato..had described the situation in a democratic city as one of intellectual anarchy. No moral education is possible because egalitarians do not see any legitimate ranking among their desires"
> Luke Foster ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1419995029414764547))

> "Precisely because a democratic person sees himself as the equal of any particular other individual, he tends to
> rate too highly the wisdom of crowds and thus himself unable to think past the common assumptions of his time. Tocqueville deplores this state of affairs," L Foster ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1420005894646124544))

> "noting the irony that the political liberation of democracy
> can foster an abject intellectual tyranny 'After breaking all the obstacles that were formerly imposed on it by classes or men the human mind would bind itself narrowly to the general wills of the greatest number'(724)" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1420005896281853956))
    
###### ID 241162577
> "But even as repressed aristocracy makes its return in this fashion,Tocqueville notes that such an industrial oligarchy would be far worse than the ruling class of feudalism: it would engage with the working masses in purely transactional fashion and feel no long-term obligation" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1420009339998380033))

> "It would also lack consciousness of its own position and so have difficulty policing itself through social norms. The workers would not respect the ownersâ€™ title to rule, and so this elite would lack legitimacy and would require cruelty to maintain its position." Luke Foster ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1420009480222347268))

> The assembly line employee who lives in suburbs, costcos and parkinglots, lives a worse life than a feudal peasant who had access to good quality farm food, knowledge about his trade, honour in his work, respect for his superiors who had a divine obligation to protect him. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1420009907244437504))

> Religious fundamentalism is particular to America b/c it is democratic. Democracies strip people of the connections and obligations to one another and direct allegiances to material goals. People become obsessive about religion as the only metaphysical respite from materialism. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1420012833018896392))

> "A few excellent universities would be worth more to achieve this goal than a multitude of bad colleges where superfluous studies done badly prevent necessary studies from being done well. (817) 
> Toqueville confirmation biasing my disdain for STEM programs rn and it's beautiful ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1420017694217277442))
