> What's the Balance? Should we make children do maths, because it's just too fundamental to miss? I'm often asked this question, as I advocate for more choice and autonomy in education. Here's what I think. 1/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003415904161795))

> Sometimes we have to make children do things. This is part of life. You can't run across the road, you can't hit other people, you can't play with fire. You can't stop your parents from going to work because we need money to live. There are real fundamentals in life. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003418437562368))

> Then there are things which adults think they must make children do, because if they don't, the children will never choose to do them. Reading, Maths, Handwriting, behaving 'well' and paying attention. Adults believe that children will thank them in the long term. 3/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003421054722048))
    
###### ID 479983539
> Adults do have a different perspective to children, that is true. Sometimes adults do need to intervene because the child's decisions (I'll just run across the road) do not consider consequences. Adults have to keep children safe, even if that sometimes makes them angry. 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003423143567363))
    
###### ID 479983541
> It's easy to extend this to everything. They can't make decisions about roads and so they also can't make choices about how they spend their time or what they learn. Unfortunately, the act of making someone do something is not neutral, particularly when it comes to learning. 5/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003425760821251))
    
###### ID 479983544
> That's because making someone do something changes the person's relationship with that activity. It makes the activity less pleasurable & it reduces the quality of learning. A book you are forced to read feels less interesting that one you choose, even if it's the same book. 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003427937619969))
    
###### ID 479983546
> Many adults don't understand this. They think that if they make children do something for long enough, they'll see the point and start to enjoy it. Maybe some do, but others learn to hate and avoid what they are being made to do. 7/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003430483591169))
    
###### ID 479983548
> I meet children who won't go near a book after being made to read against their will at school. I meet children who are terrified of maths and getting the wrong answer. Without exception, they were made to do maths and reading. Now, their fear blocks their learning. 8/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003432647761923))
    
###### ID 479983551
> When I meet children who were not made to do maths or reading (self-directed learners) they are not fearful. They may not be able to read yet, but they have fewer barriers to learning. When they do want to learn, they are able to do so without shame or fear of 'being behind''9/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003434606600193))
    
###### ID 479983553
> As adults look back on their childhoods, they often say they wish they had been made to learn something. Usually times tables or music. What they mean is that they wish they were now an accomplished musician or mathematician, without having to put in the effort to become so.10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003436942839809))
    
###### ID 479983556
> What they don't consider is the potential downside of being made to do it & how this could have affected their relationships with maths or music. They don't consider how it's possible to make a child do something only for them to grow up & never want to do it again.11/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003439174209542))
    
###### ID 479983559
> I therefore take the opposite view. I think if it's important for a child to learn something, then it's really important not to mess up their motivation by making them do it. I think a child is more likely to be a keen reader if they are able to come to it in their own time. 12/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003441661431809))
    
###### ID 479983563
> That doesn't mean adults do nothing. It means they offer opportunities and support, but they don't insist against the child's will. They recognise that forcing learning is unlikely to be effective in the long term. They find ways for children to learn and explore the world. 13/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003445985640450))
    
###### ID 479983567
> Making a child do something is a short cut on the part of adults. It is an easy way around the problem that the child is not motivated. It means that we don't ask why& we don't reassess expectations (do they really need to learn this now or could it happen in the future?). 14/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003448539996162))
    
###### ID 479983570
> Think of your own experience. Do you learn best when you're made to do something? Does being told you must do something make you interested and engaged? Or do you learn best when you are allowed to make at least some of your own decisions? 15/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003450700062720))
    
###### ID 479983573
> Most people do not learn best when they are made to do so. The quality of their motivation and learning drops. These effects last. And perhaps the most basic fundamental of all is that children are people too. 16/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/naomicfisher/status/1628003452784676864))
