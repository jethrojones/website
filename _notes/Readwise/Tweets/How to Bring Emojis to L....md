> How to Bring Emojis to Life with AI
> (Yes, you read that right)
> 1. Choose the Emoji Wisely
> Prefer detailed emojis
> 👨‍🎤 The Man Singer emoji is a good example of this. Face, hair, outfit, mic... The more detailed, the better.
> 2. Prepare Your Original Image
> We'll be doing multi-enhancements, so the initial image shouldn't be too large. (I'll explain more about this shortly)
> I started with a 512x512px image. The smaller the image you start with, the more detail-oriented the enhancer tends to be.
> I usually use Figma for design and animations. However, you can use any other tool like Canva or Photoshop.
> Or just download it from somewhere.
> 3. Upload Your Image
> Go to Magnific's website and simply drag and drop your image there.
> 4. Setup the Parameters
> This is the fun part. You can experiment here to find your own settings or follow the method I used.
> I start with high creativity and low resemblance values. Depending on how far you want to deviate from the original image, you can increase this contrast.
> First Enhancing
> Creativity: 6 / Resemblance: -3
> All Parameters
> Optimized for: Standard
> Creativity: 6
> HDR: 0 (not a fan)
> Resemblance: -3
> Engine: Automatic
> 5. The Prompt 🪄
> Since Magnific uses Stable Diffusion's technology, it uses the same syntax for prompts. But you don't need to write very detailed prompts. Just state what you want to see.
> The trick here is to use prompt weights. You need to specify the features you want to emphasize like this:
> Bowie, Portrait photo of a male singer with blue hair, (detailed eyes:1.2), (detailed hair:1.2), (detailed fabric:1.1), (detailed mic:1.1), (realistic skin:1.5), ultra-realistic, 8k
> You can change the weight values between 1.0 - 2.0
> 6. Hit that Rainbow Button
> After a short wait, you'll have a 1024x1024px image. If you like the result, download the image for further enhancements.
> 7. Reenhancing
> The system supports up to approximately 4400 x 4400 px. This means we can enhance it two more times.
> 1x → 512x512px
> 2x → 1024x1024px
> 4x → 2048x2048px
> 8x → 4096x4096px
> Now, upload the image you downloaded again. This time, we bring the values closer to each other.
> Second Enhancing
> Creativity: 4 / Resemblance: -2
> Third Enhancing
> Creativity: 2 / Resemblance: -1
> The other values can remain the same.
> 8. Share what you create!
> That's it. Now you know everything I know.
> If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
> And please share your creations with us.
> Happy Sunday everyone!<video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1733851662526103552/pu/vid/avc1/720x720/4xlnk8QHVW4Y5_rD.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1733851662526103552/pu/vid/avc1/320x320/SFYfVKsD-Xs-EKBK.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1733851662526103552/pu/pl/ksndpXop6N7ogGs8.m3u8?tag=14&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1733851662526103552/pu/vid/avc1/1080x1080/JQcBAE4lP-I96bF3.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1733851662526103552/pu/vid/avc1/540x540/4AT_M_DKSf46s3ql.mp4?tag=14" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doganuraldesign/status/1733852088411578782))
