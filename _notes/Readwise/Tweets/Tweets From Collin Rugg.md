###### ID 588567507
> NEW: 12-year old Colorado student smirks after getting kicked out of class for wearing the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ flag on his backpack, teacher falsely claims the flag is linked to slavery.
> This kid knows more about history than the teacher 😂
> “So they're the reason that they do not want the flag is due to its origins with slavery and slave trade. That is what was, um, that's the reasoning behind them.”
> FACT CHECK: The Gadsden flag originated from the American Revolution when the U.S. fought for their independence from Great Britain.
> It is now a symbol for standing up against authoritarian rule… kinda like this woman. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CollinRugg/status/1696543243557806483))
