- Summary: Cedars-Sinai has developed a new application called Xaia that uses generative artificial intelligence and spatial computing to provide mental health support. The app, available on Apple Vision Pro, offers users an immersive therapy session led by a trained digital avatar, programmed to simulate a human therapist. Xaia aims to make quality therapy accessible to all and was featured in a study that showed it to be beneficial and safe for patient use. The technology was developed with the support of Cedars-Sinai's Technology Ventures and is exclusively licensed to VRx Health for commercialization.
