> Richard Lipsky calls the athleticization of politics, “the transposition of sports values into political discourse” (1979, p. 29) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb53psxebzw302kkk6kyg32))
    - Note: Athleticization of politics is more than just a theory. It actually exists to a great extent.

> discussing them would produce more heat than light, that discussing abortion, for example, is likely to transform a community of learners into a horde of gladiators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb510sc18jmp1ppzdjcgspg))
    - Note: Hot-button issues can often lead to lots of othering in classroom settings. While unfortunate, this is what our political hot topics and the attending “dunking on” others has created.

> The destructive dynamic concerns the belief attribution, which involves both a fallacious inference and a failure of intellectual virtue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb56qarqc68bx6ryzvvvypy))
    - Note: Belief attribution also happens when people use rhetorical strategies to further their point, intentionally making things seem more repugnant than they are. For example, one student in one of my classes stated “the original salute to the flag (for the purpose of the pledge of allegiance) was the Nazi/Hitler salute.” She later admitted that this statement was intended to prove a point, but unfortunately it was actually designed to stoke a fire and give anyone who argued against her reason to rethink, lest they be lumped with the Nazis. This rhetorical strategy is disingenuous at best and downright wrong at worst.

> This attribution is a mistake on Frank’s part. Although he believes the conditional, he has no evidence that Judith does. Thus, his belief attribution—his accusation that Judith believes the conditional’s then-clause—is unwarranted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb5d3jddqqcbeem7zz5w3bs))
    - Note: We fall into the belief attribution error when we don’t seek to understand the other person, first.

> So—with apologies to namesakes—let’s use “Abe” as a name for anyone who commits assailment-by-entailment and “Vic” for Abe’s unfortunate victim. Using these names, we can now describe the general features of the fallacy. Abe believes P entails Q, where Q is an especially repugnant thing to believe. He comes to discover that Vic believes P, but Abe lacks sufficient reason to think that Vic believes P entails Q. Nevertheless, Abe attributes to Vic the belief that Q.

    - Note: A good strategy for naming characters in stories is to use their name to describe different cases where they are applying to point you are trying to make.

> Abe also fails to exhibit the intellectual virtues
> of fairness and charity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb63bea40r5mnxk7ydc5kn6))
    - Note: These virtues would also be part of [[The Law of Love]].

> As a provisional way to put the difference between intellectual fairness
> and charity, we may say that intellectual fairness is a matter of not treating the views of others as less plausible than they actually are, while intellectual charity is a matter of treating the views of others as plausible as one reasonably can—even if doing so requires improving upon the views others actually hold. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb6azr4x6v9dtgksmhyx8vj))
    - Note: Intellectual charity is like the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Intellectual fairness is like the silver rule, don’t treat others how you don’t want to be treated.
      Sometimes, we even have to assume positive intent as it relates to a specific person. (See TP Melinda Miller)

> charity requires more. In interpreting others’ views, we act with charity when we interpret those views so as to make them seem as plausible as we reasonably can, even if this requires “massaging” those views in order to improve them. We don’t merely avoid attributing to others positions that are less plausible than the ones actually held. Rather, we seek the most plausible versions of our interlocutors’ views, where this sometimes requires making “friendly amendments” to those views. Further, we do this both for the sake of those interlocutors and for the sake of the truth. Such charity is intellectually virtuous in part because it ensures that all parties to a dispute become familiar with the most plausible available alternatives. It helps to ensure informed selection from among competing views and helps us avoid rejecting the spirit of a view on the grounds that many renderings of its letter are implausible.

    - Note: Not only do we assume positive intent, we demand positive intent. Only to be surprised when someone shares their less desirable concerns were the actual reality!

> In his book Intellectual Character (2002), Ron Ritchhart notes several features of so-called “thinking routines.” These are routines involving thinking that: (i) consist of a few steps; (ii) are easy to teach and learn; (iii) are easily supported; (iv) can be used repeatedly in a number of different contexts; and (v) are explicitly geared toward helping those who practice them become better thinkers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb70y5ph92avpgqpke9gd0f))
    - Note: Having routines and practices that remind us to be intellectually charitable, or to develop any other virtue, can be very powerful. Connecting with our sage power or doing things to feel love for the person we are talking with will be helpful. see [[positive intelligence]] and [[the law of love]]

> Once students see this, the debate becomes less personal. It becomes more about testing for logical entailments and less about pinning problematic beliefs to one’s classmates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb79rantweax4p1ww267cv5))
    - Note: It is all well and good for these discussions and thinking routines to happen in the classroom, but it is even more vital to do this outside of the classroom, where the virtues can really be tested in the real world, where we don’t have a teacher/professor to referee.

> What’s wrong with these attitude-to-agent inferences? Most generally,
> they’re faulty because their premises (claims about an agent’s attitude toward some proposition) are poor evidence for their conclusions (claims about the agent herself). And no inference is good if its premises fail to provide good evidence for its conclusion. There is, in short, a large logical chasm between a single belief attribution (e.g., she’s against affirmative action) and a negative evaluation of an agent (e.g., she’s a racist). Having been warned about this gap—it is to be hoped—we’ll be less prone to fall into it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb7t02rpxz50mn7zm8wbcsk))
    - Note: If someone doesn’t believe what I believe, they are an idiot. I should not assign a characteristic to them despite the ease of doing so.

> As psychologist Robert Abelson insightfully observes, we treat our beliefs
> like possessions. Consider how we speak of our beliefs. We acquire them, we obtain them, we buy into them, we maintain them, we abandon them, we discard them—just as we do our cars and computers. As a result, when our beliefs are under attack, we protect them just as we protect our physical possessions.13 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb81wt8acr46dkqgwkcq1sk))
    - Note: When our beliefs are our identity, any attack on our beliefs is an attack on our identity.

> fundamental attribution error.16
> This error—called “fundamental” because it’s so pervasive in human cognition—concerns our tendency to overestimate the influence of stable character on the actions of others and to underestimate the influence of others’ situations in explaining their behavior. For example, if we see another bump into a table, we’re apt to characterize him as clumsy. If we ourselves bump the table, well, it was poorly placed and the room was too small. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcb8bsawah8wy2tf4gjn7hvj))
    - Note: Other people have faults, but we don’t. We do all things for a reason.
