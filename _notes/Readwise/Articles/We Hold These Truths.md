- Document Note: The document discusses the framing and formulating of the Constitution of the United States of America and how it established a single, sovereign state and a government with limitations and branches. The idea of constitutional government originated in ancient Greece, and the American Constitution was not the first constitution. The American Constitution created the first federal republic in the world, and citizenship is the primary political office under a constitutional government. The document also discusses the defects of the 18th-century Constitution, such as the inadequate recognition of the inalienable right of all human beings to political liberty. The effectiveness of constitutional government depends on it being a government of laws rather than a government of men, and the constitutional government of Great Britain is defective in this regard.

- Summary: The document discusses the US Constitution, its origins, and its unique place in history as the first federal republic in the world. The Constitution created a government and established a new nation, unlike the Articles of Confederation, which formed a loose union between sovereign states. The document emphasizes the importance of citizenship and understanding the three documents that are the American testament: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. The author also suggests that a radical reform of basic schooling is needed to improve Americans' understanding of their political system.

> I am sorry to say that most Americans think of themselves as the subjects of government and regard the administrators in public office as their rulers, instead of thinking of them selves as the ruling class and public officials as their servants - the instrumentalities for carrying out their will.

    - Note: Mortimer J. Adler understands that which most of us have never learned. The government is our tool as a people. We are not subjects of the government, but they are our servants.
