- Document Note: According to the document, the North Carolina study refers to a policy change in which the state lowered its grading scale for high school students in 2014. The threshold for an A dropped from 93 to 90, and as a result, student grades went up significantly. However, the easier grading standards had unintended consequences, as lower-performing students increasingly disengaged from school, fell further behind their peers, and eventually scored lower on the ACT. The study found that the main beneficiaries of the easier grading scale were students in the top half of the performance distribution, while students with incoming test scores below the median saw no GPA increases at all.
- Summary: The article discusses how many schools are withholding honest feedback from struggling students through no-zero grading policies or by passing students along even though they haven't mastered the content. These trends have created a disconnect between subjective evaluations like grades and objective data like attendance and achievement, leading to rising grades but declining attendance and academic performance. A new working paper from Brown University examines what happened when North Carolina lowered its grading scale and found that the easier grading standards had unintended consequences, mainly affecting the lower-performing students who increasingly disengaged from school and fell further behind their peers. The article emphasizes the importance of clear, objective, and high standards for students' long-term trajectories.

> North Carolina is unique in that it has a state-level grading scale for high school students, and in fall 2014, it lowered that scale. The threshold for an A dropped from 93 to 90, from 85 to 80 for a B, from 77 to 70 for a C, from 70 to 60 for a D and from 69 to 59 for an F.

    - Note: It’s all made up. If they can arbitrarily change the grading scale then it doesn’t mean anything anyway. 
      We only adhere to these things because we are scared of the ambiguity of it not having something that we can point to to say, yes this is working. 
      So what’s the alternative? We focus on values. 
      You determine your values and then act in accordance with them. That’s how life works anyway.

> The new, laxer standards allowed the lower-performing students to increasingly disengage from school and fall further behind their peers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf9zms8x7vtgnek7cygzw4yp))
    - Note: When comparing students to other students, there has to be a winner and a loser. What if we didn’t compare students to other students. What if we didn’t have delineations or methods to compare students?

> On the more rigid end of the spectrum, there’s also [a growing body](https://www.the74million.org/article/holding-back-struggling-readers-helps-them-and-their-siblings-study-finds-2/#:~:text=Comparing%20kids%20who%20placed%20below,in%20both%20reading%20and%20math.) of literature suggesting that holding back students who are struggling to read can be beneficial for their long-term trajectories — and for their younger siblings as well ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf9ztsg1y7n1zcfer2x4d498))
    - Note: Holding kids back only holds them back socially. We should be continuing to teach them specific skills at their level, rather than think that just because they happen to be a certain age they are ready for that particular grade level.

> Hanushek estimates that the lost learning suffered by students during the pandemic will translate into [a lifetime 6% tax](https://www.educationnext.org/generation-lost-the-pandemics-lifetime-tax/) on their earnings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf9zy2x6yghjvcyh85ejecd7))
    - Note: Talk about making things up. He has no idea what this time off of school because of our bad policy decisions will do to students. He’s only comparing it to things that we have done in the past. Using the same poor measures of performance to make determinations that meet with the norm of what success looks like.

> Leniency may be easier, but honesty is the best policy, and kids who are the furthest behind will benefit the most from clear, objective and high standards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfa00ycnewy8phzv8emr5sbm))
    - Note: I advocate that we have no expectations of students. That we leave their expectations up to them. We all have a desire to progress, grow and learn. James Haslip’s personal experience showed this is the case. Kids want to learn. In fact they love it. We just do a terrible job of helping them experience that love of learning because school is not about learning. It’s about compliance and performing on tests. 
      It’s a total cop out on the part of educators to blame things on test scores.
