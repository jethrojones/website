- Summary: Motivation and Learning Theory: An Overview discusses the contrast between the biological perspective and behaviorism in understanding human behavior and learning. The biological perspective assumes that individuals, including children, are programmed to survive and contribute to their social group. Behaviorism, on the other hand, views children as passive and blank slates. The document explores the implications of these perspectives for teaching and learning, highlighting the shift from behaviorist approaches to more biologically informed approaches. It also discusses the importance of understanding children's needs and motivations, as well as the role of relationships and autonomy in fostering intrinsic motivation. Additionally, the document touches on cognitive theory and the development of understanding in children.

> In their book Biological Boundaries of Learning, Martin Seligman and Joanne Hager characterize this transition-the replacement of the blank slate with the acceptance of biological preparedness-as the beginning of a "scientific revolution" in the study of animal behavior. Rather than look outside the organism, as they had for external stimuli, scientists began to look inside the organism-as Jean Piaget had been doing in the field of human cognition for years.

    - Note: The blank slate theory is ridiculous.

> candy, stickers, or praise). Likewise, we would not assume that children have to be enticed or coerced to learn unless, of course, the learning was arbitrary and was perceived by the children as arbitrary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm77912tegsy8t7bq40g2aph))
    - Note: School is precisely this: arbitrary and perceived as arbitrary!

> In reviewing the theories and research that make up our understanding of attachment, intrinsic motivation, cognition, and sociocultural transfer, several principles emerge in support of our understanding of a biological perspective on hun1an learning and behavior: • First, children are seen as adapting to the world around them in rational, self-protective ways. Thus, if we y-jew their behaviors as rational, we will be better able to understand the causes and goals of any given behavior and better able to influence it positively.
> • Second, children are seen as having distinct needs which they a~e biologically prepared to satisfy. Thus, if we understand these needs and the ways ~ -·which they are and are not being met, we can help children satisfy them in ways that are supportive of their development.

    - Note: Summary part 1. 
      Kids adapt. Kids have distinct needs they are biologically prepared for fulfilling and learning how to fulfill.

> example, young children believe that things that move are alive and that things have to be equal to be fair; later on they develop more differentiated views of life and justice.
> • Fourth, the human environment of evolutionary adap"tiveness has an essentially social and communal/cooperative nature, which means that humans are biologically prepared to live and interact in ways that preserve their social relationships and their community.
> • And finally, susJ1 a community-a supportive and challenging social environment-is essential for child~en's intellectual, social, and ethical development. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm77dvxc4d4evp6gexy3kbzs))
    - Note: Summary part 2
      Humans are biologically prepared to living in social relationships and their community. 
      That community is essential for children’s development.
