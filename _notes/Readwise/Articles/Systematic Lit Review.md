- Summary: A systematic literature review is different from other types of literature reviews because it focuses on a clearly formulated question and uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research. The purpose of a literature review is to review existing research and situate your own analysis within the context of the literature. Traditional literature reviews often fail because they don't provide context for the studies being reviewed or synthesize the information. In contrast, a systematic literature review aims to overcome these limitations by following a systematic process, setting clear criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies, increasing transparency, and focusing on the impacts and outcomes of interventions or policies.
