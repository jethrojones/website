## Highlights
###### ID 252854078
> In early May, Anthony Klotz, an associate professor of management at Texas A&M University, did an interview with Bloomberg about a possible spike in job turnover. “The Great Resignation is coming,” he warned. A few weeks later, the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed a record 4 million Americans had left their jobs in April. Suddenly, people were reaching for ways to refer to the phenomenon unfolding before them—to brand it, to make sense of it. Klotz’s catchy off-the-cuff terminology, now printed on Bloomberg’s pages, seemed to fit the bill. And just like that, a name was born.
    - Note: Reporting and recording things makes them the truth. It makes them real.

> Instead, naming at scale is a reckoning of influences that compete for public adoption, typically sprung from journalists, politicians, academics, celebrities, or those of influential reach

> But what we call things matters. It characterizes what we deem important, how we conceptualize a movement, and what we remember

> For economists or historians who adopted the term in public, this was often a deliberate move to recall the past crisis and “to bring people back to the lessons of the Great Depression,” says James.
    
###### ID 252855089
> This was a way to underline the severity of the moment as a delayed aftershock to World War I, while also framing something that felt unprecedented in familiar terms.

> “Names are ways of making connections,” says Harold James, a professor of history and international affairs at Princeton University and author of The War of Words.

> But focusing on resignation as a crisis flattens the dramatic change for American values, which could have far-reaching consequences outside of the workplace.
    
###### ID 252855754
> In this case, a resignation crisis feels like a limiting metaphor when leaving a job may just be collateral to a deeper realignment in American work life.
    
###### ID 252855867
> Beautifully, language doesn’t happen by fiat. There is a natural process of competition for terms, a constant evolution of expression, and an endless variety of ways for saying things which have a chance at entering our common lexicon.
    
###### ID 252855903
> We are in the midst of massive change and it’s essential that we continue to understand and describe it, rather than grasping for a single, overloaded term.
    - Note: And part of the problem is that (social) media demands a name for pithy commentary and limited characters (and attention).
