> But the youngest generation seems to know less and less about their history and government.
> Eighth-grade students continued a decade-long score decline on a national U.S. history assessment and posted the first-ever decline in scores on a national civics assessment, according to results released Wednesday by the National Center for Education Statistics.

    - Note: It is less and less meaningful to them what these tests are assessing. Kids don’t care or have a reason to know what the first amendment stands for, but ask them if they think that people should be able to report on whatever they want and hold school officials accountable. The problem is only partly that the scores are down, but really the problem is do our students understand their rights.

> These assessments challenge students to show their knowledge and skills as they prepare to become engaged citizens in a democracy. Too many students are struggling to understand and explain the impact of civic participation and how our government works and the historical significance of events. This is concerning. Quite honestly, I was shocked. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haqga96vykt95gg72m1agxy8))
    - Note: I am shocked that Peggy Carr, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics actually believes that these assessments challenge students to explain how they are preparing to be engaged citizens in a democracy!

> On the civics assessment, scores declined for the first time ever, by two points ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haqge364trmht5dvmgnv9tfz))
    - Note: So, basically nothing has changed in regards to civics. The results are not that different from where they were in 1998. This is an indictment of the education system refusing to change! Only 1/4 of our kids are proficient since 1998? What is concerning is that we are not doing anything to change that over these two and a half decades.

> We need to provide every student with rich opportunities to learn about America’s history and understand the U.S. Constitution and how our system of government works,” Cardona said. “Banning history books and censoring educators from teaching these important subjects does our students a disservice and will move America in the wrong direction.

    - Note: Cordona is making a false statement here. His words are overly broad as a rhetorical strategy that further distances people from coming to an agreement.

> The federal government currently invests five cents per K-12 student – about $4 million total – in civic education, according to the Institute for Citizens and Scholars, compared to roughly $54 per K-12 student to support science, technology, engineering, and math – or STEM – teaching. Moreover, Only seven states require students to receive a year of civics education, while 13 states have no requirement that students take civics education at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haqgp38f6wsc3mfg9qzernmq))
    - Note: This is false equivalency, it is much more expensive to teach STEM than it is to teach Civics. The real issue here is that so few states have requirements for civics instruction
