- Summary: In 2023, the evidence-based medicine (EBM) paradigm has been weaponized against vaccines and public health interventions. The misuse of the EBM paradigm has led to the spreading of misinformation about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and nonpharmaceutical interventions like masks and social distancing. Some proponents of the EBM paradigm argue that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the only valid method of investigation and dismiss other types of evidence. However, this narrow application of the EBM paradigm is not suitable for public health interventions and fails to consider the practicality and ethics of conducting RCTs. The misuse of the EBM paradigm has also been associated with the promotion of alternative medicine and ineffective drugs during the pandemic.

> There is good reason to question that assumption at the heart of physicians casting doubt on public health interventions because there haven’t been RCTs that they view as adequately powered and rigorous testing the efficacy of these interventions and even better reason to question the —or even sometimes outright argument—that no intervention should be used until it has been validated in large RCTs, almost regardless of the practicality or ethics of doing such trials.

    - Note: We cannot only rely on RCTs for decision-making. We have to make choices with the info we have available

> Ideally, these RCTs are then double-blinded, so that neither the subjects nor the doctors or medical personnel administering the drugs and assessing outcomes know which group any given subject is in. Double blinding is especially important in clinical trials with more subjective outcomes such as pain, for which placebo effects can be strong, but it’s also important even in trials with “hard” outcomes like tumor progression because it could affect how clinicians interpret tests and radiology studies if they know which group a given patient is in. Moreover, such clinical trials have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, which ensure that those being treated actually have the disease, do not belong to a group that might be harmed by the drug, and are subjects who are likely to benefit if the drug does have efficacy; i.e., does work.

    - Note: Doesn’t the necessity of these safeguards to prevent people from being influenced by things, other than the drug prove that things other than the drug do actually work?

> he also noticed that the same physicians were often content to cite non-RCT evidence for purported harms of vaccines and COVID-19 interventions, a clear double standard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp4kx9ewa08zvesp3wbmayvc))
    - Note: But this author is having the same double standard by saying that ivermectin can’t be used to treat COVID-19 because there’s not strict enough evidence.

> EBM is just a tool, a framework to evaluate evidence, and like any other tool or framework it has strengths and weaknesses. In its current form, EBM’s key strength, where it performs the best, is in the evaluation of pharmaceutical drug treatments for well-characterized medical conditions and diseases, in particular as a tool to determine if a new drug is sufficiently effective and safe to be licensed by regulatory agencies for sale ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp4m2yrvqrkkcc2f5rz2d1e0))
