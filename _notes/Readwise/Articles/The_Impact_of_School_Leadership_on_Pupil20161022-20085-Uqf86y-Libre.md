- Summary: This research on the impact of school leadership on pupil outcomes combines questionnaires with detailed case studies to show that effective heads improve student outcomes through their values, strategies, and adaptability. The study identifies three school improvement profiles based on contextual characteristics and emphasizes the importance of supporting heads in disadvantaged communities to enhance teaching conditions and student achievement. Findings highlight the significance of stable leadership, strategic actions, and contextual adaptation in improving pupil outcomes, particularly in challenging school environments.

> All of these strategies have implicitly assumed a link between school leadership and student learning and achievement since this relationship between the quality of leadership and school improvement has consistently been reinforced, within the literature, as significant.

    - Note: Core leadership practices

> Robinson and colleagues (2008) found significantly larger effects for
> ‘instructional as compared with ‘transformational’ leadership practices. Instructional leadership practices were those which engaged teachers (or engaged with teachers) in initiatives directly related to student learning. Transformational practices were described as those which were more teacher than student focused. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq3pe096cg1ddfee5yqrn2bw))
    - Note: Larger effects come from instructional us. Transformational.

    - Note: How can we simplify this even more? What essential characteristics can be taken from this for the purpose of Principal Leadership Development.
    
###### ID 680828517
> The research demonstrates that heads in more effective schools are successful in improving pupil outcomes through who they are - their values, virtues dispositions, attributes and competences - the strategies they use, and the specific combination and timely implementation and management of these strategies in the unique contexts in which they work.

###### ID 680830033
> The image that we see emerging from this research on successful schools is of individual leaders working to transform a system that for some time has been based on prescription to one where ‘professionalism’ provides the basis of a new approach. The key question is ‘how do we get there? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq3qxqczb8xb1f40vewnf2qt))
    - Note: The system in the past has been focused on prescription (what does that mean?) and is moving to an area focused on professionalism.

> The first is to emphasise that this not an argument against ‘top down’ change. Neither ‘top down’ nor ‘bottom up change’ work just by themselves, they have to be in balance - in creative tension. The balance between the two at any one time will depend on the heads’ diagnosis of the development phase of the school and policy context and their prioritising and layering of strategic actions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq3qwcvgxagjazmx4zs7v0x3))
    - Note: Distributed or collaborative leadership is essential. Everyone has a role.
    
###### ID 680830313
> Second, in creating this new landscape of schooling, policy makers need to understand the limitations of their role and to focus their energies increasingly on creating the conditions in which this new professionalism can thrive. This implies horizontal and lateral ways of working with assumptions and governance arrangements very different from what we know now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq3qz5r77jj83e6fvfx8v3jp))
    - Note: Policy makers need to focus on what they can do to promote “professionalism” rather than prescribe things. My interpretation is that policy makers need to give more flexibility for principals to own their work and professional development, rather than focus on what they *should* do.
    
###### ID 680830555
> Third, leaders themselves and those responsible for leadership training and development need increasingly to focus their efforts on the elements of the new leadership qualities as illustrated in this chapter through ‘the twelve claims’. It should be no surprise to realise that this is relatively unknown territory. The main difficulty in imagining this landscape is that the thinking of most people is constrained by their experiences within the power structure and norms of the established system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq3r1tq23va70tjd6ayhh0d7))
    - Note: [[the twelve claims]] is where the focus of professional development should probably lie.

> Finally, it is becoming clear that collaboration is at the forefront of leadership innovation. This implies a significantly more substantive engagement with other schools in order to bring about system transformation. This is being termed System Leadership. Specifically, a system leader may be defined as a school leader who is willing and able to shoulder wider system roles and in doing so is almost as concerned with the success and attainment of students in other schools as they are with their own. It is about taking the values, behaviours and skills described in this report and summarised in this chapter and applying them to the system as a whole. This is the next leadership horizon and one that builds on the research reported here. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq3r31rgch1nwsmrd43f6akt))
    - Note: [[system leadership]] as defined by Day2008 is all about schools collaborating with each other. This demands the principals are in collaboration with other schools.
