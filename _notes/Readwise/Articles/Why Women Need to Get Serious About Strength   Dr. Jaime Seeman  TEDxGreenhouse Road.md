- Summary: In her TEDx talk, Dr. Jaime Seeman discusses the importance of women prioritizing strength training for their overall health. She shares her personal experiences of navigating societal expectations and myths about women's bodies. Dr. Seeman challenges three common myths that deter women from strength training: the fear of getting bulky, the belief that weightlifting is too hard on the body, and the perception that weightlifting is primarily for men. She emphasizes the numerous health benefits of resistance training and encourages women to start prioritizing their physical strength for a longer and healthier life.
