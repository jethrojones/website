- Summary: In this chapter, the authors present a framework for understanding moral behavior that contrasts with popular views in moral psychology. They argue that a comprehensive account of morality should include the role of virtues and the influence of culture. They emphasize the importance of moral habits, reflection, and judgment in moral development. The authors also discuss the role of moral understanding and moral emotions in shaping moral choices and behavior. They refute the claim that moral choices are irrational and emphasize the active engagement of individuals with their cultural contexts.

    - Note: I appreciate how this is pushing back against the “research” or the “science” saying people must always act this way. When it comes to people, it’s understandable for the science to give some opinion about what “could be” causing people to act a certain way, but it is ultimately incapable of defining everything because we have the ability to choose for ourselves what our lives and choices look like.

    - Note: I disagree with this statement. I believe that we are all at our fullest potential at that point in time. If we *can* do better, we *do* do better. If we can’t, then we do our best in the moment. If at any time, someone is not their “best” then that current state is their best, even if they may have performed better previously. I see learning and many of these character skills as non-static. They continue to change and adapt over time, depending on our way of moving through our lives.

    - Note: So much of what we “know” is based on these cultural experiences and norms. For example, my daughter has much more exposure to podcasting because she has grown up around me doing it and talking about it for many years of her life. While I and a friend are the same age, and grew up close to each other, we have a very different relationship with technology not only because of our personalities, but also because of our exposure to it and family relationship with it. My dad bought a computer early on in the days of personal computers and we had one in my home for almost as long as I can remember. This gave me an experience with it that causes me to not ask dumb questions about how technology works today, like it does for him. Case in point, he asked why his iPhone contact was suggesting that it was his wife, rather than him when sharing his contact details with others. That’s because he is likely sharing her AppleID and that is tied to her, not him.

> The capacity to override and change one’s own habits of inter pretation is critical, because by doing so people can actively shape their future moral habits. People grow morally by making an effort to become more aware of their own habits of mind and behavior, by acknowledging and trying to overcome their biases, and by work ing to understand others’ interpretations.

> MORAL EMOTION
> Many distinct emotions energize people’s moral convictions and increase the likelihood that people will act on those convictions. The variety of human moral emotions is immense. It includes feelings that negatively evaluate the self (such as shame and guilt), those thatnega tively assess others (such as righteous anger), feelings that appreciate the moral qualities of self or others (pride, admiration, gratitude,inspi ration), feelings that show concern for others’ suffering (compassion, empathic distress), and feelings that delight in the others’ well-being empathic joy). Each of these emotions is elicited by a different kind of situation, and each serves a different role in the larger domain of moral functioning. Moral emotions are built into the human species through evolution,
> as the new science perspective correctly asserts. Many moral emotions are close to universal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm84a0vnt8capcen3rqn53f3))

> the comfort zones of familiar faces and here-and-now experi ences. \Vise parents will resist the urge to take the part of their own children when they’re in the wrong, and good citizenship in any society demands a concern for those who don’t share the same ethnicity, social class, family and community ties, or religious and ideological beliefs. In these cases, the circle of compassion can be expanded to include distant acquaintances, strangers, and sometimes even opponents. This is possible because individuals are not at the mercy of their

    - Note: We are capable of resisting our own biases. In fact, it is one of the ways that we develop our moral character, by examining and recognizing areas where we have made judgements in the past that did not sit well with us afterward.

    - Note: This also highlights the need for individual choice. We choose to act in certain ways, and our responses are not simply pre-programmed based on our evolution or life experiences. They are regularly in flux.

> ordinary people, not to mention those who do real evil in the world. But in saying that inner truthfulness, humility, and faith facilitate pos itive moral growth, we also wish to indicate that the absence of these virtues severely limits this potential for development. When people fail to look honestly at themselves, when they are arrogant, dogmatic, and closed-minded, when they are unwilling to consider the critical feed back of others. they will be unlikely to continue learning and evolving morally over time. Beyond the lack of inner truthfulness, a thorough going cynicism that prevents some people from finding anything to believe in or commit to also limits their capacity to reach their full moral potential.
