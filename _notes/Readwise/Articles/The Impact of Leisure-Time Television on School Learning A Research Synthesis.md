- Document Note: This document discusses the impact of leisure-time television on school learning. The author notes that while the fact that television affects school achievement is not challenged, research efforts to examine these effects have uncovered inconsistent results among studies and even within single studies. The article describes a synthesis of 23 research studies which indicated that there is a slight negative relationship between television viewing and achievement. The author also discusses the various research methods and sample sizes used in different studies and the need for further analysis of the viewing by IQ interaction.

> ht line. The problem of representing these more complex relationships so that they could be summarized across studies might have been intractable, except for one important fact: unlike most of the variables of concern in education, weekly hours of televiewing were automatically measured on a ratio scale, with a true zero point (no viewing at all) and equal-interval units (e.g., hours). Thus, average amounts of viewing were directly comparable across studies
> in a way that average scores on the various achievement tests used in different studies were not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdhfzfz67ezn7cjnkh504x93))
    - Note: As much as the powers that be try to make educational data comparable, the fact is that there are so many variables that it is truly challenging to make them work.
