> Virtually all of the high-poverty districts in the United States have student performance levels below the national average (Boschma & Brownstein, 2016), meaning that students in these schools are not achieving the full intent and rigor of the academic standards at their grade level. Separate research found that in classrooms where a majority of students were of color, 4 out of 10 never received a single grade-level-appropriate assignment (TNTP, 2018).
