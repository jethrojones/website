- Full Title: The Process of Leadership Development: How Leaders Experience Growth Over the Span of Their Careers
- Category: #articles
- Document Note: The article discusses a study on the process of leadership development over the span of a long and successful career. The study involved a retrospective examination of 17 exemplary leaders and their experiences of developing into extraordinary leaders. The findings resulted in an empirically derived model of leader/leadership development, which departs from the age-stage configurations in developmental literature. The article also includes a literature review on the variables that change over time and what facilitates change in leader/leadership development. The research design used was qualitative research interviewing.
   The text is a summary of a dissertation on the process of leadership development, which aims to understand the experiences of senior leaders as they progress in their careers. The research design is guided by phenomenological constructivist philosophy, which seeks to uncover and describe the essence of what is cognizant and common to each participant in a phenomenon. The study includes 17 leaders who generously shared their experiences of developing into extraordinary leaders. Participants described events, circumstances, and feelings that had enabled or accelerated their growth as a leader throughout their careers. The study found that the process is comprised of themes that provide direction along a pathway, and the process might be experienced differently by individuals whose performance outcomes are less than ideal.

> The strategy of inquiry was qualitative research interviewing. The research interview was defined by Brinkmann and Kvale (2015) as a professional, in-depth conversation in which knowledge is constructed as the result of two people interacting on a topic of mutual interest. The research design was guided by phenomenological constructivist philosophy, which seeks to uncover and describe the essence of what is cognizant and common to each participant in a phenomenon (Creswell, 2013; Lincoln & Guba, 2013).

> The research interview is both method and craft which means that the flexibility and skill required of the semi-structured life world interview is significant (Brinkmann & Kvale, 2015). The craft of in-depth interviewing has been practiced and developed by this researcher for 30 years as a leadership development coach, strategic planning consultant, and executive search consultant. A critical and direct activity of this experience has been in-depth interviewing of leaders to determine skill, motivation, and ability to change and

> Participants were 919 cadets at the United States Military Academy (USMA), 81% male, average age 20.68 years, engaged in a 5-year leadership development program. The independent personality measure was a 12-item widely used reliable and valid instrument. The dependent measure was a 12-dimension, 47-item, USMA developmental review report completed by the cadet’s supervisor. The research design first examined change in the dependent measure (developmental review report) through regression analysis. The average tendency was for each cadet to improve over time in seven of the 12 dimensions, with individual differences in rate of improvement. They then modeled individual growth curves focusing on those seven dimensions to examine variability in development trajectories by adding the personality predictors at the between-individual level.
