- Summary: Prioritization in schools is a challenge, as they often prioritize academic achievement above all else. However, it is important for schools to recognize that the formation of youth, particularly in terms of moral and civic development, should also be a fundamental priority. This means integrating character education into the school's mission statement, leadership goals, and overall structure and schedule. Character education can be incorporated into the academic curriculum through activities such as reflection processes, outdoor programs, community service, and international programs. By prioritizing character development, schools can create a holistic educational experience for students.
