- Category: #articles
- Document Note: The text titled "Democracy in Education" discusses the need for the recognition of freedom of intelligence in schools, as well as the discrepancy between the undemocratic organization of schools and the growth of democracy in social life beyond the school doors. The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing the intellectual and spiritual individuality of both teachers and students and the need to encourage them to take working possession of the machinery of democracy of mind. The text also highlights the importance of greater play for the individuality of the child in the school, which means securing conditions that will give outlet and direction to a growing intelligence. The text concludes that the organic, positive principle involved in democracy must be put in entire possession of the spirit and work of the school to encourage freedom, independence, and initiative in every sphere of social life.

    - Note: The document is talking about whether schools are democratic or not. Democracy means that everyone has a say and is treated fairly. The document says that schools are not as democratic as they should be. This is because teachers and students don't have a lot of say in how things are run. This can cause problems and make things not work as well as they could. The document suggests that we need to make schools more democratic so that they work better and everyone is treated fairly.

> Many reformers are contending against the conditions which place the direction of school affairs, including the selection of text-books, etc., in the hands of a body of men who are outside the school system itself, who have not necessarily any expert knowledge of education and who are moved by non-educational motives.

    - Note: If this is what democracy means, then we are in no way democratic in schools. Dewey is talking about teachers here specifically, but this applies to students even more so. Students should have a say in their education. If they don’t know enough to have a say, then it is incumbent upon us to teach them enough so they can have a say.

> Moreover, the argument proves too much. The more it is asserted that the existing corps of teachers is unfit to have voice in the settlement of important educational matters, and their unfitness to exercise intellectual initiative and to assume the responsibility for constructive work is emphasized, the more their unfitness to attempt the much more difficult and delicate task of guiding souls appears. If this body is so unfit, how can it be trusted to carry out the recommendations or the dictations of the wisest body of experts? If teachers are incapable of the intellectual responsibility which goes with the determination of the methods they are to use in teaching, how can they employ methods when dictated by others, in other than a mechanical, capricious, and clumsy manner?

    - Note: The only education that matters is a spiritual (or if you don’t like word, character or values) education.

    - Note: We have systematically given our students second-hand everything. They do not think for themselves, they do not create for themselves. They simply do the least amount they need to appease the taskmasters that are over them.

    - Note: Great John Dewey quote that someone else said. In schools, acquiring takes the place of inquiring.

> Until the emphasis changes to the conditions which make it necessary for the child to take an active share in the personal building up of his own problems and to participate in methods of solving them (even at the expense of experimentation and error), mind is not really freed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9h6bvaqjyjnpsvtb1n4xb02))
    - Note: This has been true in my own study of what students have been able to accomplish as a part of their school work when given not boundaries, but freedom. When they are in charge, they have the ability to greatly surpass our wildest dreams. Rather than “raise our second-hand standards” we should eliminate our expectations and allow students to pursue inquiry and their own learning, solving their own problems and finding ways to take their abilities to the next level. In so doing, they will likely smash our expectations completely.

    - Note: Our fear of “something going wrong” and our desperate adherence to “safety comes first” has forced our kids into mischief and destructive behavior.
