## Highlights

> According to the story, a child with Down Syndrome was told in a patriarchal blessing that he “played a key role in ushering Satan out of God’s presence. The young man was told that he was so hated and despised by Satan, that he was blessed to come into this life in such a state as to be beyond the power of the adversary.
    
###### ID 258948658
> Notice that both stories try to account for a particular present problem: a seeming “restriction” in mortality–one from priesthood/temple access, the other regarding cognitive ability. The former seems to be an element of punishment due to bad acts, the latter a blessing and protection because of good acts. Interestingly, the blessing/protection reasoning was more recently applied to the priesthood/temple problem by former BYU professor Randy Bott. The restriction was protective, much like the Down Syndrome condition.6
    
###### ID 258948685
> Such explanations tend to skip over the difficulties of a mortal life of disability by looking ahead to Act III, when in the resurrection such disabilities will vanish. In these and other ways, Act II for a person with disabilities becomes massively short–hardly an important scene in the overall play
    
###### ID 258949014
> At the same time, an explicit debunking of such a story also runs the risk of upsetting Church members who may have been comforted by the idea that a loved one’s cognitive condition signals a brighter past and a more hopeful future. (Debunking here seems more risky than dealing with racial speculations.)
    
###### ID 258949938
> Mormon doctrine is not static, unified, univocal, or complete. This discussion can also be brought to bear more closely on questions about differences between official and unofficial (or folklore) doctrines and the ways various beliefs circulate between pulpit and pew.
    
###### ID 258950759
> The architecture of Mormon practice is already well-poised to provide meaningful spiritual experiences for people with disabilities and their caregivers. Such experiences stand to be greatly enhanced when cognitive disability is better understood within the framework of Mormon theology.
