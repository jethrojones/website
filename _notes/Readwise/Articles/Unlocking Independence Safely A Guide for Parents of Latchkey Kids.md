- Summary: There are currently around 7.7 million latchkey kids in the U.S., double the number in 2000. State age recommendations for leaving kids home alone vary from six in Kansas to 14 in Illinois. To ensure the safety of latchkey kids, it's important for parents to assess their child's readiness, provide means of communication, and utilize technology such as smartwatches, smartphones, smart locks, and security cameras. Leaving children home alone can teach them valuable life skills and foster independence when approached responsibly.
