- Summary: Harvard University's popular online computer science course, CS50, plans to incorporate artificial intelligence to better grade assignments, teach coding and personalize learning tips for its growing number of students online. Professor David J. Malan is fine-tuning an AI system to mark work and test a virtual TA to evaluate and provide feedback on programming, which would provide students with tailored support, reserving more in-person and Zoom office hours. While education leaders have feared AI encourages cheating, proponents argue CS50's use of AI could improve the quality and access of online learning, which Grand View Research forecasts to be a $348 billion industry by 2030.
