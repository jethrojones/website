## Highlights
###### ID 373857192
> The dose-response meta-regressions suggest that ~30-60 minutes of resistance training per week is associated with the largest risk reduction for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease incidence, and cancer rates
    
###### ID 373857207
> for these three outcomes, there appear to be no risk reductions (and possible increases in risk) for individuals performing more than 130-140 minutes of resistance training per week.
    
###### ID 373857496
> a combination of aerobic and resistance training was associated with lower mortality and disease risk than either aerobic or resistance training in isolation.
    
###### ID 373857544
> you can tell them that they’ll likely reap most of the health benefits with just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week, thus massively reducing the perceived barrier to starting.
    
###### ID 373857562
> this meta-analysis suggests that just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week is associated with a host of positive health and longevity outcomes, meaning that a considerable reduction in training volume will still result in a worthwhile and meaningful dose of training.
    
###### ID 373857590
> most readers probably engage in resistance training for more than 130-140 minutes per week. This meta-analysis suggests that such a training dose may actually be associated with higher all-cause mortality risk, cardiovascular disease risk, and total cancer risk.
    
###### ID 373857771
> all-cause mortality and cancer risk were lowest in people who performed >0 and <2 hours of resistance training per week, while cardiovascular disease risk was lowest in people who performed >0 hours and <1 hour of resistance training per week.
    
###### ID 373857629
> Liu and colleagues found that cardiovascular disease events, morbidity, and mortality were lowest in people performing two resistance training sessions per week, with potential increases in risk for people performing four or more resistance training sessions per week.
    
###### ID 373857856
> the studies in this meta-analysis mostly used older subjects.
    
###### ID 373857860
> It’s entirely possible that the optimal dose of resistance training for older adults is a lot lower than the optimal dose of resistance training for younger adults.
    
###### ID 373857899
> it’s entirely possible that people start working out like crazy after they’ve been told they’re at high risk for disease or imminent death. In other words, doing a lot of resistance training might causally reduce your risk of disease or early death, but it might also be associated with increased risk, because the people who are doing a ton of resistance training systematically differ from the people doing a bit less resistance training.
