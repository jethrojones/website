> So try asking for it to be **concise** or **wordy** or **detailed**, or ask it to be **specific** or to **give examples**. Ask it to write in a tone (**ominous, academic, straightforward**) or to a particular audience (**professional, student)** or in the style of a particular author or publication (**New York Times, tabloid news, academic journal)**. You are not going to get perfect results, so experimenting (and using the little “regenerate response” button) will help you get to the right place. Over time, you will start to learn the “language” that ChatGPT is using. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsa8ys4nfr6gcbxk9p9vp2j1))
