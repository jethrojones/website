- Summary: The content discusses the importance of taking a developmental and psychological approach to moral and character education. It highlights the lack of comprehensive models and knowledge about moral development and what works in promoting it. The chapter presents a general model of the moral person and discusses its application in school settings. It also explores the developmental aspects of the moral person and the influence of parenting, social norms, and social contexts on moral reasoning. The chapter concludes by mentioning the Eleven Principles of Effective Character Education.

> Simply engaging in describing a moral person leads to debate and resistance. When one begins to apply that to schooling and children, the debate becomes even more contentious. When the general population learns the terminology, its relevance to their children, and so on, then they often resist as well. So theorists, researchers, and practitioners alike question their term du jour and search for a consensual and noncontroversial alternative, something that is in essence a mythical quest. It does not exist, because it is the nature of the referent that is controversial, not the nature of the term used to connote it. I assume the eternal search for the holy grail of a noncontroversial consensual term for this domain will continue, but I prefer to ignore the inevitable semantic squabbles and get down to the business of fostering the development of character in youth.

    - Note: Astute observation that the search for the right term is like the search for the holy grail, we won’t find it. And like Indiana Jones, when we do find it, we will have to choose to let it go…

    - Note: The overlapping piece is key here as these topics seem too interrelated to be siloed.

> Moral reasoning, however, begins developing in preschool or the primary grades and continues throughout the lifespan. The development of moral identity, although building on prior developments such as self-concept, largely occurs in late childhood and adolescence (Erikson, 1968).

> Parents at higher stages of moral reasoning and parents who use authoritative parenting strategies of open communication, nurturance, and control (Baumrind, 2008; Hoffman & Saltzstein, 1967) tend to have children who can reason at more mature levels of morality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmfvhydr70t42ahnn492axkz))
    - Note: I am intrigued and surprised by this declaration. Higher levels of parental control tend to result in children who can reason at more mature levels of morality? That seems counterintuitive.

> The structural similarity of parent-child and teacher-child relations allows for such extrapolations, both psycholOgically and SOciologically, and, given that there is much more empirical research on parental impacts on child development than on teacher impacts on child development, this provides a rich source ofinformation on the effective strategies to be applied in character education.

    - Note: I’ve often said that you can’t out-teach the character of the family. Only the child can choose to stray from what is taught (either explicitly or implicitly) in the home.

> Currently, there is a controversy in the field between behavioral approaches to behavior management (most notably School-Wide Positive Behavior Intervention and Support; Homer & Sugai, 2000) and developmental discipline. School-Wide Positive Behavior Intervention and Support is seated primarily, but not exclusively, in a framework of behavioral reinforcement and environmental engineering, which is anathema to the character education emphasis on promoting intrinsic motivation, the seventh of the Character Education Partnership'S Eleven Principles ofEffective Character Education (Beland, 2003; see Exhibit 10.1).

> Ideally; professional development is sustained (multisession), directly linked to the school mission or improvement plan, directly relevant to practice, of high quality (e.g., knowledgeable presenter), and experienced by a critical mass of the school staff (and if not all are present, disseminated to those who were not).

    - Note: Correlates with Jones 2022 (How to be a Transformative Principal) that observations of teaching should be focused on the school mission and directly relevant to practice.

> Wilson and Byrne (1999), in a review of research on professional development, concluded that effective professional development should (a) focus on creating "communities of learners that are refining teaching practice" (p. 194), (b) not be a delivered "package" but rather should empower them to reconceptualize their teaching and become learners of teaching, and (c) focus on teacher-peer interaction as a pedagogy of professional development.
