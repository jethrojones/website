- Summary: Dr. Marvin Berkowitz presents the PRIMED model, which consists of six design principles for evidence-based character education. The model emphasizes the importance of character development in schools and highlights the interconnectedness of moral, performance, intellectual, and civic character. Dr. Berkowitz argues that character education is necessary for creating a better world and improving academic outcomes. The PRIMED model has gained recognition and is included as one of the national prevention recommendations in a report on school safety by the US Department of Education. The six design principles of the PRIMED model are prioritization, relationships, intrinsic motivation, modeling, empowerment, and development over a lifetime.

    - Note: Even though kids are with us for 13 years total, that’s not enough time to truly develop their character. But it is enough time to lay a solid foundation from which they can grow and develop. Thirlby (2022) states that good leaders have values and character established early in their lives even before they are teenagers. So the efforts of schools really do make an impact.

> administration came in the word character kind of disappeared from the scene for a lot of reasons I'm not gonna bother going into now to see it resurrected here in this report was great to see and then for us it was nice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnydr4hr4pbf49mm2sqetajr))
    - Note: I am curious to know why the word character went out from being in vogue￼

> always had two goals 1 goal was to equip current and future leaders with what they needed to lead a school
> character quick them acknowledge the skittles the methods and so on but the second one was to transform them to be the kind of person whose best position to lead a school like that because not every leader is the kind of person and the kind of leader who can pull this off ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnyeae8vvae23y6exr9a6h9d))
    - Note: So what are the characteristics that make it nearly impossible to pull this off? And how do we make sure to not hire for it?
