## Highlights

> Many district leaders recognize the importance of the democratic purposes of public education. All too often, however, they seek to be “democratic” through activities that they regard as tangential to their core work: an open meeting to discuss a specific issue, for instance, or a one-time outreach to a particular group. Treating such one-off engagements as “democratic” can suggest that public participation in social institutions can and ought to be relatively rare or narrowly focused.

    - Note: These examples are simply lip service and do not constitute efforts to really be democratic. If schools were democratic, they would be run in very different ways. Kids with special needs would not be scheduled last if at all.

> Fostering open and engaging democratic processes for school governance.
> Honoring pluralism to cultivate inclusivity and promote equal membership.
> Fostering a culture of inquiry and experimentation to “do” democracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haqhxbkdn1jc42c1rp9d8sb4))
    - Note: I have a hard time believing that any school would be interested in doing these things at any level of depth that is not lip service to the ideas.

> Add student board representative(s). Student voice is essential ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haqj0f9d1n3k7amywdymsste))
    - Note: Reminds me of the time that my school district said “Jethro you’re in charge of this student council group. Help them know that they can’t have a a 4-high school dance. We want them to participate but only in the manner that we determine they should participate.” Again, lip service.
