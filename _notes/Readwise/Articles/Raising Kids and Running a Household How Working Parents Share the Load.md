- Summary: In close to half of two-parent families, both parents work full time, a significant increase from 1970. Families with two full-time working parents are economically better off, but working mothers are more likely than fathers to say that being a parent has made it harder for them to advance in their careers. While parenting and household responsibilities are more equally shared when both parents work full time, mothers still tend to take on more responsibilities related to children and household chores. There is also a gender gap in perceptions of division of labor, with mothers more likely to say they do more than their partners.
