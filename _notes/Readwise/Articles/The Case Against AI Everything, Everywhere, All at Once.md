- Document Note: The author suggests that we question the tools and the people shaping AI and slow down the frenzy through acts of friction, while developing impactful policies and ethics guidelines. They argue that the current top-down authoritarian technique is threatening individual, societal, and business autonomy and that private and public sector leaders can slow this down through acts of friction and by not giving in to the “Authoritarian Intelligence” emanating out of Silicon Valley. The author proposes that with the right priorities and guardrails, AI can help advance science, cure diseases, build new industries, expand joy, and maintain human dignity and the differences that make us unique.

- Summary: The author argues against the current approach to AI development, which is being controlled by a small number of tech leaders who are striving for absolute ideological power. This Authoritarian Intelligence is threatening individual, societal, and business autonomy. The author suggests that power should be distributed between large and small companies, vendors and customers, government and business to create checks and balances and lead to better decisions and less risk. With the right priorities and guardrails, AI can help advance science, cure diseases, build new industries, expand joy, and maintain human dignity.
