- Summary: One effective strategy for prioritizing character education in schools is to designate staff members who are specifically responsible for leading and coordinating the initiative. These staff members ensure that all aspects of character education are in place and being implemented effectively. They are held accountable for the quality control of the program and provide professional development to support its implementation. An example of this approach is seen at Colegio Los Nogales in Bogota, where a staff member named Maria Mercedes Casas serves as the coordinator and director of the character education element, helping to maintain its priority and effectiveness.

    - Note: So important to have someone whose job it is to make sure that Character ed is happening. And being held accountable for all the things that go into it. And, I think it is important that it is not the principal who is primarily responsible.
