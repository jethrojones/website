> The work of John Dewey, for example, which has probably done the most to shape dialogues on education and democracy, has not led to resolution.

> Since conceptions of the greater good will differ, justice oriented students must develop the ability to communicate with and learn from those who hold different perspectives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha4w8tyjrbm4ckdamnt0h05k))
