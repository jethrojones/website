- Summary: A systematic literature review involves several steps, starting with developing a review protocol that outlines the intentions, topics, and methods of the review. The search for relevant studies is conducted using specific search terms, and the results are narrowed down by reviewing titles and abstracts. After removing irrelevant studies, the remaining articles are read and coded based on inclusion criteria. The findings from the selected studies are then analyzed and synthesized to draw conclusions and identify gaps in the research literature. Meta-analysis is a mathematical process used to calculate the impact of quantitative data in some systematic reviews, but it is not discussed in detail here. The ultimate goal of a systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic and inform future research.
