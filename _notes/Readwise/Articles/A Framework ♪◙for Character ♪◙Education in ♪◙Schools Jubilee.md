- Summary: Character education is essential for the development of children's characters and should be a shared responsibility among parents and schools. The aim of character education is to help students become good persons and citizens who lead fulfilling lives. It involves cultivating virtues such as courage, justice, honesty, compassion, and integrity. Schools play a crucial role in character education through role-modeling, teaching, and creating a positive school culture. The ultimate goal is to promote human flourishing and create a society where all individuals can thrive.

> More generally speaking, the character of children cannot simply be put on hold at school until they reach the age where they have become wise enough to decide for themselves. Some form of character education will always be taking place in school. The sensible question to ask about a schoolâ€™s character education strategy is not, therefore, whether such education does occur, but whether it is intentional, planned, organised, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6zfbxabv3g0500xw7aj2qq))
