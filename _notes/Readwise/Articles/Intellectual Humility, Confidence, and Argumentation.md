> intellectual conduct. By that term, I refer to the fairly stable and habitual ways that a person conducts their intellectual activities—how they articulate their claims, form beliefs, react to claims, and so on. It has affective, bodily, and cognitive aspects, and so captures not just a person’s psychology, but also their posture, tone of voice, facial expression, and social comportment.

    - Note: Be dangerous so you can have a soft heart. This is the phrase that Clint Markland said to me a few weeks ago. His argument is that having a soft heart doesn’t matter much if that is your only option. There’s not much value in a soft heart if you have no choice but to have a soft heart. There is enormous value in having a soft heart if you are dangerous. Because then you are choosing to have a soft heart.

    - Note: Our confidence does not live in isolation. We gather with others and exchange our ideas.

We test the waters as we share these things and this brings us closer to understanding what we did not previously understand. Intellectual humility comes into play when we recognize that others can add to our knowledge. We become confident when we know we have put in the work and have done the things to show that we know what we are doing.
