- Summary: The article discusses the importance of considering the source of data when making decisions based on survey responses. While it is common to focus on the data itself, the questions asked in the survey play a crucial role in shaping the results. The author suggests that the language and phrasing of the questions can significantly impact the responses received. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that data is subjective and influenced by the choices made in the survey design. Despite this subjectivity, the author emphasizes that this judgment call is what makes data valuable and beautiful.

> If you slide back a few steps, you'll see that it's all a judgement call. How you asked, what you asked, when you asked, which words you paired together, how you started the question... All these things matter. In fact, they are the matter that form the answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpakghawnb22kd6ac8h4bjkd))
    - Note: This is so vital. Ultimately, you come up with the judgement call that makes things happen. Even if you donâ€™t think you are.
