- Summary: The author of the article coined the term "enshittification" to describe the decay of online platforms, such as Facebook. The process involves platforms abusing their users and business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. The article discusses how companies like Facebook exploited their users, advertisers, and publishers and withdrew surplus from them to hand it to shareholders. The author believes that competition, regulation, self-help, and worker power are the four forces that discipline companies and serve as constraints on their enshittificatory impulses.

> Users, advertisers, publishers — everyone was locked in. Which meant it was time for the third stage of enshittification: withdrawing surplus from everyone and handing it to Facebook’s shareholders.
> For the users, that meant dialling down the share of content from accounts you followed to a homeopathic dose, and filling the resulting void with ads and pay-to-boost content from publishers. For advertisers, that meant jacking up prices and drawing down anti-fraud enforcement, so advertisers paid much more for ads that were far less likely to be seen. For publishers, this meant algorithmically suppressing the reach of their posts unless they included an ever-larger share of their articles in the excerpt. And then Facebook started to punish publishers for including a link back to their own sites, so they were corralled into posting full text feeds with no links, meaning they became commodity suppliers to Facebook, entirely dependent on the company both for reach and for monetisation.
> When any of these groups squawked, Facebook just repeated the lesson that every tech executive learnt in the Darth Vader MBA:
> “I have altered the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1rd6f3adcch6e9skht96gz))

> For bosses, there’s a downside to motivating your workers with appeals to a sense of mission. Namely, your workers will feel a sense of mission. So when you ask them to enshittify the products they ruined their health to ship, workers will experience a sense of profound moral injury, respond with outrage and threaten to quit.

    - Note: People really do feel a sense of moral injury. When the thing they’ve dedicated their lives to is shown to be nothing meaningful at all.

> But starting in the 1980s, with the rise of neoliberalism, competition authorities all over the world adopted a doctrine called “consumer welfare”, which essentially held that monopolies were evidence of quality. If everyone was shopping at the same store and buying the same product, that meant that was the best store, selling the best product — not that anyone was cheating.

    - Note: Contrast this, with with what it was like in Russia, during communism, where people said that there was all the money in the world, but nothing to buy, and under capitalism, there was everything in the world to buy, but no money

> the web is being devoured by apps, and apps are ripe for enshittification. Regulatory capture isn’t just the ability to flout regulation, it’s also the ability to co-opt regulation, to wield regulation against your adversaries.

> Think of our ad blockers again. Fifty per cent of web users are running ad blockers. Zero per cent of app users are running ad blockers, because adding a blocker to an app requires that you first remove its encryption, and that’s a felony. (Jay Freeman, the American businessman and engineer, calls this “felony contempt of business-model”.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1sf6h5v228sg8qj843mdtq))

> There are four constraints that prevent enshittification: competition, regulation, self-help and labour. To reverse enshittification and guard against its re-emergence, we must restore and strengthen each of these. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1sjvrs7rdcmn50gazck4q2))

> The last time the US Congress enacted a broadly applicable privacy law was in 1988. The Video Privacy Protection Act makes it a crime for video-store clerks to leak your video-rental history. It was passed after a rightwing judge who was up for the Supreme Court had his rentals published in a DC newspaper ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1sq55gk1hr5rkyw6g7h9e1))

> That was the last time Americans got a big, national privacy law. And the thing is, there are a lot of people who are angry about it. Worried that Facebook turned Grampy into a QAnon? That Insta made your teen anorexic? That TikTok is brainwashing Gen Z into quoting Osama bin Laden?
> Or that cops are rolling up the identities of everyone at a Black Lives Matter protest or the Jan 6 riots by getting location data from Google?
> Or that red state attorneys-general are tracking teen girls to out-of-state abortion clinics?
> Or that Black people are being discriminated against by online lending or hiring platforms?
> Or that someone is making AI deepfake porn of you? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1sqkw6794jv39q2z8frstb))
    - Note: Privacy really is and should be bipartisan
