- Summary: Virtual reality is being successfully integrated into mathematics classrooms to enhance students' learning experiences. One school in Kentucky, Gavin H. Cochran Elementary School, has been using virtual reality to help students understand math concepts like volume. The immersive nature of virtual reality allows students to manipulate objects and visualize spatial relationships in a way that traditional methods cannot. The use of virtual reality has been shown to improve students' understanding of abstract concepts and increase their motivation in math. Teachers have found that virtual reality technology supports student learning and creates new and exciting experiences in the classroom.

As a Signature Partnership school with the University of Louisville, the school receives a yearly grant through the Oxley Foundation to use for whatever the school and university think will best support the professional development of the educators involved. Cochran decided to use the funds to integrate technology into its curriculum, particularly using virtual reality focused on mathematics instruction.
