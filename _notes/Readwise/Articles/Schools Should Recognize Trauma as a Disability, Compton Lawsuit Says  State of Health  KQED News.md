## Highlights
###### ID 440615699
> A group of middle and high school students in Compton have filed a first-of-its-kind federal lawsuit saying violence at home and in their neighborhoods has impaired their ability to learn at school. The students, along with three teachers who are also plaintiffs, allege the Compton Unified School District has failed to recognize and address their trauma-induced disabilities, and therefore has denied their legal right to an equal education.

> Peter said he has excelled in school at times, but often he’s been too preoccupied to focus. His rage led to a slew of suspensions and expulsions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn10ae1r89gs7qjd0jbkwgek))

> Learning requires a state of attentive calm, Hudson-Price and her colleagues note in court papers. But it’s one that traumatized kids rarely if ever achieve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn10aqmf285m2zht9fn8z23c))
    
###### ID 440615774
> Last September, District Judge Michael Fitzgerald allowed the case to move forward, ruling that the students could be entitled to accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, just as learning-disabled students are.

    - Note: I’m curious what his rationale was for this? And isn’t providing accommodations for everyone sufficient?
    
###### ID 440616106
> The lawsuit seeks consistent mental health support for students, as well as training and coaching for teachers to understand trauma and respond appropriately. The plaintiffs want to end punitive discipline like suspensions and expulsions, which they allege are counter-productive because they push traumatized kids out of school and into the criminal justice system.

    - Note: I mean, this is good for business.
    
###### ID 440616152
> Hudson-Price said the plaintiffs are not asking for screening of individual children. Instead, they demand that the district establish so-called trauma-informed policies for all of its 26,000 students because so many of them are affected. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn10demj3y4gnaxvtgd3m0p6))
    - Note: What exactly are these policies?
    
###### ID 440616257
> In court papers, Compton Unified School District officials contend that trauma isn’t a disability. They argue that attaching the stigma of disability to kids because they come from poor, high crime neighborhoods would be devastating. What’s more, they say students’ bad behavior could be the result of immaturity or bad judgment, not the trauma they might have suffered. Still, they contend that the district is sensitive to trauma, citing trainings for teachers and school staff. An item posted last month on the district website highlights increased counseling services for students through a partnership with a local non-profit.

> But repeated trauma also affects children profoundly during their earliest years, because of the plasticity of their brains, writes Joyce Dorado, a psychologist and professor at the UC San Francisco in her declaration supporting the lawsuit.

> The result, according to scientists, is that the brains of traumatized children are essentially re-wired so that the smallest upset can cause them to lash out in anger in a fight or flight state or to withdraw, removing themselves psychologically from a situation. Thus, traumatized kids can’t learn as well as those whose brains have developed in calmer circumstances. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn10mfrf5xzq7ewhndq55p85))
