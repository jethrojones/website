> In line with their focus on citizenship more generally, 81% of teachers say students should be required to take a civics class.

    - Note: It's interesting to me that teachers aren't concerned about changing their students' minds about things. 
      - Does that mean they don't believe they are good at teaching kids things? 
      - Or does that mean they don't believe they have great influence over kids? 
      - If so, why do they think they should be teaching these things? 
      - Or does that mean they think they would teach it in such a way that it would be purely academic? 
      - And if it is purely academic, then is it even worth teaching, if it doesn't change behavior?

> Parents (78%), all adults (79%), and teachers (85%) say schools should teach values as well as factual information. Adults age 65 and older (89%) are especially keen on this approach, and moderates (85%) and conservatives (80%) are more likely than liberals (69%) to support this idea. Those who want to see schools focus on core academics are less inclined to favor teaching values (64%). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8fxtev1p428ggwt3ncrzsgp))
    
###### ID 584489846
> The level of support for teaching values exceeds the number who say it would be possible to get people in their community to agree on a basic set of values that should be taught. Sixty- one percent of all adults say this kind of agreement is possible, down from 69% when this question was asked in 1993.

    - Note: It would be difficult to have everyone agree on values.
