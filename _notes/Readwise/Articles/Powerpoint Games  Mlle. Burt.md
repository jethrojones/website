## Highlights

> There are many templates out there now for various games - Jeopardy, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Hollywood Squares, just to name a few. The templates are great because all you have to do in input the information. Pretty easy but don’t forget to check it over before you show it to the kids… imagine the uproar if something happens to make the game, heaven forbid, “unfair”! (I hate that word, can’t you tell?)
    - Note: These are great fun!
