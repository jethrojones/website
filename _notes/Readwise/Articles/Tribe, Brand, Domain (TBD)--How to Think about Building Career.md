> Working with 100s of young professionals, we have developed a simple rubric that seems to help frame the options and focus on what really matters. The rubric is this: Tribe, Brand, Domain.
    
###### ID 315753631
> A job is a transitional arrangement with an employer that has certain features easy to measure and compare: title, compensation, benefits, etc. Sometimes we create comparisons between jobs that focus on exactly these things.
    
###### ID 315753634
> A career is something you invest in over the long term. It takes shape longitudinally, layer upon layer. While the person in charge of your job may be your boss, the person in charge of your career is you.
    
###### ID 315753642
> Who will decide how to sequence jobs, layer experiences, and develop facets of your professional self? Nobody but you.
    
###### ID 315753650
> career from entry-level to executive. Viewed through this lens, it’s important to focus on things that will matter over the long run. Starting salary doesn’t matter. Starting title doesn’t matter (much). Benefits don’t matter… so what does matter?
    
###### ID 315753652
> These concepts are listed deliberately in order of importance. They can help put any job decision into a larger, “career” frame of reference. They can also be used to evaluate a career as it develops over time.
    
###### ID 315753675
> Look to your left and to your right. Who do you see? People who inspire you? Challenge you? Stretch you? Do you get energy from your peers, or do they suck energy from you? Do they encourage you to do your best work or do they bore you? Are you your best professional self among your workmates?
    
###### ID 315753674
> If one of your peers finds the opportunity of a lifetime, and they need the best and brightest to join them and reap the rewards of an amazing product, market, etc., who will they call? The people they know and respect. If one of those people is you--lucky you!
    
###### ID 315753676
> On the other hand, if you look to your left and see Sleepy, and to your right and see Dopey, you may be in trouble. It almost doesn’t matter how much an employer pays you--no amount is enough to sacrifice the opportunity to build relationships with best-and-brightest peers.
    
###### ID 315753682
> Do you love talking about your work at parties, family gatherings, reunions? If so, your work is aligned with your personal Brand.
    
###### ID 315753685
> Each job you take will follow you. It will attach itself to your resume and follow you for the rest of your adult life. You will use it to introduce yourself, you will answer questions about it, and you will weave it into your professional narrative. If you are passionate about what you are doing, it doesn’t matter how recognizable the name.
    
###### ID 315753730
> A key piece of a successful career is getting good at something.
    
###### ID 315753744
> No one develops all the required domain expertise in one single job, so it is up to you to sequence experiences so you can develop each facet of your professional expertise deliberately.
    
###### ID 315753763
> TBD can be used to evaluate a single job opportunity: Does this job fit the TBD bill? Or are you perhaps being lured by money or title to do something not so TBD?
