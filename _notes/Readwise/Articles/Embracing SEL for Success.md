## Highlights

> COVID-19 has highlighted the distinction between what we teach and what kids need. While many of our students lost academic momentum, educators have told me that what is more concerning is that students lost their ability to focus, work collaboratively, and manage themselves.
    - Note: Learning loss is something educators made up to fit their own self-importance narrative. Kids canâ€™t experience learning loss. Only in the eyes of the state is that possible.

> Students are the products of their experiences, and they come to us with different social-emotional learning skills, just as they come to us with different linguistic skills. Or mathematics skills. Or swimming skills. All skills, including SEL skills, need to be taught developmentally over time.
    - Note: I think for me, the question is how do I teach them those skills in a student-driven learning way?
