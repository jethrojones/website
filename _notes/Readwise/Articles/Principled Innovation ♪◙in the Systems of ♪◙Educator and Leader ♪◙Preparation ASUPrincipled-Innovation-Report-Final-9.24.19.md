- Summary: Principled innovation is the ability to imagine new concepts and form new solutions guided by principles that create positive change for humanity. Character development is seen as crucial in principled innovation, with character adding purpose to innovation. Character is social, cultural, contextual, and developmental, and emerges in the relationships between educators and students, among educators, and among students. Arizona State University's Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College aims to prepare educators who can work at different social and organizational scales and discern between innovating for the sake of innovation and innovating with the purpose to serve humanity. The college has developed guiding principles and defined character assets to foster a culture of change and positive impact.

> ducation must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But Education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. … We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character—that is the true goal of education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate.

> Character is social, cultural, contextual, and developmental. It is a dynamic interaction of characteristics within a person and the context in which the person operates and develops. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6yq0j3v0nbw7hdwbyd2jhv))
    - Note: I appreciate how MLFTC defines character here. It seems alive.

> Character Development is the life-long process of constructing character. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6yrkvh3tgfyd1pw2tcqtz2))
    - Note: How does this compare to Thirlby’s definition of leadership development?

> The ecological model is central to MLFTC’s unique framework and illustrates how character develops as principled innovation is practiced in various learning environments. It represents an inductive and bottom-up approach to character. It also demonstrates the bi-directional movement as each environment interrelates with the others, contextually and in nuanced ways. Our model represents a relational approach rather than a one-directional approach in which character is dictated from the top-down, such as from the teacher to the student, based on the ideals of equity and reciprocity, where all stakeholders contribute to the shaping of character within and across institutional contexts and life situations.

    - Note: This model is fine, but it is too confusing for anybody to remember and implement. Therefore, unfortunately, it is practically useless.
