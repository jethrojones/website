- Summary: This article examines the development of national primary education systems in various regions between 1870 and 1939. The study focuses on three institutional dimensions: centralization, secularization, and subsidization. The authors find that the secularization of public school systems can be explained by path-dependent state-church relationships and partisan politics. Finally, the study reveals that the provision of public funding to private providers of education, especially to private religious schools, can be seen as a solution to religious conflict.

> Identifying three particularly important sources of institutional variation—centralization, secularization, and subsidization—we address three basic questions: Why did some states create centralized primary education systems when others were content to leave schools to municipalities or parishes? Why were some school systems controlled by religious institutions when others were entirely secular? And why did some states but not others provide public funding for private schools?

> Politics mattered greatly when mass schooling was introduced. Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, liberals, Catholics, conservatives, and socialists fought with uncommon intensity and bitterness over the governance of primary education. These struggles, as we will show, shaped national education regimes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8tj9z5s5swgbkb41yxytb93))

> on the other hand, attributed the same outcome to institutional isomorphism: in their analysis, countries adopted compulsory primary education since they wished to mimic other countries that they saw as exemplars of modern nation states.

    - Note: Adopting because “they saw exemplars” is a sickness in education. We copy so much without actually looking at the underlying reasons why things are working that way in that other place. We need to do a better job of understanding what leads to decisions across the board.

> The main actors in our analysis are therefore conservative and Christian political parties, liberals, social democrats, churches, and religious minorities. But we must also consider political institutions, which mattered greatly to the balance of power between these groups. We identify three crucial institutions in the period that concerns us here: democracy, federalism, and established religion.

> These were all anticonservative movements, but for
> very different reasons (cf. Berman 2006). Liberals and social democrats, empowered by democratization, sought to nationalize education since they saw the creation of a national education system, staffed by a cadre of professional teachers, as away to break down the old social order, with its patchwork of parochial schools, eliminating old privileges and hierarchies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8tkt4qvagnpra958yyj26vq))
    - Note: These systems again were about [[power and control]]. Anticonservative movements were trying to steal power from others.

> the need for a welltrained military may well help to explain the expansion of education and primary education enrollment, as Aghion, Persson, and Rouzet (2012) have argued in a recent article, but it is not clear that it should similarly affect the structure of the education system.

    - Note: The need for military fighters doesn’t determine which system a country adopts for primary education, but it does necessitate a need for education of the populace.

> During Fr `ere-Orban’s time in office, there was a great showdown between the Catholic Church and the secular state. Immediately after winning office, the liberals nationalized primary education and banned the practice of letting municipalities “adopt” Catholic schools instead of creating their own, secular schools (the Belgian reform was in many ways similar to the Ferry reforms in France a few years later).

    - Note: Secular systems are threatened by the [[power and control]] the church has.
