- Summary: Trust is crucial for school leaders to earn the support and respect of their faculty and school communities. Principals who fail to build trust can face frustration and failure in their visions. Trust is essential for effective communication and leadership within schools. Building trust requires patience, planning, and a strong sense of care for the students and teachers. Trustworthy school leaders are more likely to create productive learning environments and achieve the goals set by society.

> By balancing a strong sense of care for the students and teachers of her school with high performance expectations, Brenda has fostered a school wide culture of trust. Responsibility for school improvement is shared. By working hard herself, Brenda sets an example and is able to command an extra measure of effort from her teachers. These efforts have been rewarded with above-average performance from Brookside students on measures of student achievement.

> The success of our educational system has created the very conditions that enable the common person to think critically and to challenge the status quo. Consequently, better education has created greater need for trustworthiness on the part of leaders and professionals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq29kjbfyzvf5b8zmwk6eam3))
    - Note: The problems we face are sometimes self-inflicted, and sometimes a result of our own success

> Trust is one's willingness to be vulnerable to another based on the confidence that the other is benevolent, honest, open, reliable, and competent (Mishra, 1996; Tschannen-Moran & Hoy, 1998, 2000). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2b31qbr5qdjmkwfvdq1aj2))

> Solomon and Flores (2001) note that trust is "cultivated through speech, conversation, commitments, and action. Trust is never something 'already at hand,' it is always a matter of human effort. It can and often must be conscientiously created, not simply taken for granted" (p. 87). These authors assert that it is unethical to withhold trust without good reason just as it is unethical to treat a person unfairly in other ways.

    - Note: Trust requires effort. And it requires effort on both sides of the trust relationship.

> Parents who trust educators to care for their children are confident that the educators will consistently act with the best interests- of their children in mind; that their children will be treated not only with fairness but with compassion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2b6c66z07fc04yvevyc6z6))
    - Note: This is why there has been such a backlash from conservative parents who think schools are making their kids liberal and from liberal parents who think schools are forcing their conservative ideals down their kids’ throats. Seemingly, in my personal experience there is more of the former than the latter. And even some of our readings in other [[educ 7610]] classes have argued that there is evidence for schools being more liberal and progressive.

> Teachers were more willing to give the extra measure and meet the high demands that Brenda placed on them because of the level of support they received. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2bdagxgpbj7h28x2xwj23e))
    - Note: Teachers typically have to wait years before they see the fruits of their labors. This can be very challenging for anyone to wait that long. Small acts of gratitude for present actions go a long way.

> Reliability implies a sense of confidence that you can "rest assured" that you can count on a person doing what is expected on a regular, consistent basis. You need not invest energy worrying whether the person will come through or make mental provisions of how to manage in case of failure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2bjvwryeygmhhj192vccjk))
    - Note: It does take a lot of mental energy wondering if someone is going to come through or not

    - Note: Same can be said for teachers and their relationship with students.
