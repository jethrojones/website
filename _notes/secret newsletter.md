My Secret Newsletter is up and running. I'm not associating this with me because I'm trying to build something in a different way. I'm planning to use [[facebook ads]], a low budget right now of just $20/day. 
I have a facebook page, instagram account, and an X account. All brand new. 

## Update March 17, 2025
Ran ads for two weeks. Spent $260. 2 signups. 

Don't know what I'm doing with facebook ads! 

But I do have 46 people. Several of which I don't know. So something is working. 

## Update March 4, 2025: 
Been running ads since last week. No signups. 

Spent about $60, and had about 250 visits to the web site, but nobody has completed the 
signup process yet. One facebook post has about 650 reactions, so there's something there.

8 email subscribers. All invited personally by me.
