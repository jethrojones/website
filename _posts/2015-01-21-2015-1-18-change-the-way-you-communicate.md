A couple years ago I wrote a book called 
[Paperless Principal](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/paperless-principal/id558201943?ls=1). A year ago, I wrote about a strategy I learned that completely changed how I communicate. Over the last year, I have been creating a simple process to make my communication better. Last week, I released a 
[new product](http://www.jethrojones.com/new-products/communication-cards) that will help you change how you communicate for the better.


These communication cards will change the way you interact with people. They are amazing! What they allow is open communication where people are used to making assumptions and not telling the whole story. They've helped me a ton, and I am sure they will help you as well. All you do is print them out, hang them where people can see them, and voila! Instant communication! It takes a little more work than that, but it sure helps a lot.
