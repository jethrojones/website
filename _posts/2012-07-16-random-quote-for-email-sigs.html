<em>Add a random quote to every email @macdrifter @smilesoftware @keyboardmaestro</em> #summerblog12<br />
<br />
I’ve been collecting quotes for a long time. I don’t know how many I have, but there are a lot of them. If I were to print out the text document that they are all saved in, it would be 34 pages. <br />
<br />
Here are a couple random quotes:<br />
<blockquote>
“Creativity is piercing the mundane to find the marvelous.” - Bill Moyers&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong.” - Joseph Chilton Pierce&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“Creativity is discontent translated into arts.” - Eric Hoffer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“Things are only impossible until they’re not.” - Jean-Luc Picard</blockquote>
I’ve seen a lot of people put quotes at the bottom of their emails, and if they are lucky, they remember to change them every six months or so. I even get sick of my signature quotes, so I can’t imagine how those who get my emails feel. And I know I get sick of seeing the same ones on others’ emails. So, while trying to learn about something else, I stumbled across the <a href="http://blog.smilesoftware.com/">SmileSoftware blog</a>, and I found <a href="http://blog.smilesoftware.com/2011/12/03/random-snippets/">this particularly useful blog post</a>. Turns out, this is really easy to implement. All you have to do is create a group called “Random” and add your quotes to that group. You don’t even have to create an abbreviation for the quotes.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLgpqHnpruf3UhounSE-KL-10Bp_f3sk5MaRNibbpR5GmwoglbBJrR-7oaJdqomhlPIoS3c4_p0tO6n3qWrV6a9RwC0cAJkXOBm0ldvArVv_1tNRxz6U-fUpxp_ou09xiL3iXFkJuNDpPh/s1600/TextExpander-20120714-003638.png.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLgpqHnpruf3UhounSE-KL-10Bp_f3sk5MaRNibbpR5GmwoglbBJrR-7oaJdqomhlPIoS3c4_p0tO6n3qWrV6a9RwC0cAJkXOBm0ldvArVv_1tNRxz6U-fUpxp_ou09xiL3iXFkJuNDpPh/s1600/TextExpander-20120714-003638.png.png" /></a></div>
<br />
Then, you create a snippet called “rrand”, or something like that. And change the content to Applescript (This part is pretty important, so don’t forget to do that.)<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Then, you insert this code as the content, with “rrand” as the abbreviation:<br />
<br />
<pre><code>tell application "TextExpander"

&nbsp; &nbsp; set groupCount to count (snippets of group "Random")

set randomIndex to random number from 1 to groupCount

&nbsp; &nbsp; return plain text expansion of ¬

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; snippet randomIndex of group "Random"

end tell</code><code></code></pre>
<br />
That is all on the <a href="http://blog.smilesoftware.com/2011/12/03/random-snippets/">Smile blog</a>.<br />
<br />
The next part is what is really cool. I use <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>, which actually took me a long time to get into it. I found a bunch of helpful hints and helps on <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/category/keyboard-maestro/">Macdrifter</a>. So, I thought I would add to what I have learned from Gabe, and see if it would work.<br />

<br />
What this does is adds a random quote to the end of my email, and then sends it when I press CMD+SHIFT+F. I chose that because I send emails in Mail.app via the shortcut CMD+SHIFT+D, and F is really close to D, so I still retain the option of not adding a quote if I don’t want to. However, it is so easy to do, that I think I will add quotes to the bottom of all my emails. <br />
<br />
A couple geeky notes about the Keyboard Maestro Macro. <br />
<br />
I had to choose “Type Keystroke” instead of “Insert Text” because TextExpander wouldn’t expand “rrand” unless I did the keystrokes for each letter. Also, using the “CMD+Down Arrow” keystroke forces the cursor to go to the bottom of the email, regardless of what is there. If I already have a signature, there are a few returns built into that so there is always room for a quote.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to do this in Outlook, I would just change the last action from “Type the CMD+SHIFT+D Keystroke” to “Type the CMD+Return Keystroke”, and it would work the same way. <br />
<br />
This was a pretty fun thing to do. As I use some of these new-to-me tools I realize how much fun it is to tweak with my computer and make it work for me. <br />
