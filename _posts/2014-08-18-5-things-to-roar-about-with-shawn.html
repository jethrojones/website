In this interview, we discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Shawn is most excited about relating to technology in his school.</li>
<li>Why do we use technology in schools?</li>
<li>Learning as scaffolding and focusing on learning first, and technology second.</li>
<li>Blended learning as having digital and physical tools in front of the student at the same time.</li>
<li>Powerful for learning are situations that capture what a student is thinking.</li>
<li>Shawn&rsquo;s role as principal to teachers regarding technology in the school: Permission to try, permission to fail.</li>
<li>How to gain trust from your faculty. We are in a relationship business.</li>
<li>They need me to support them when they need support and challenge them when they need to be challenged.</li>
<li>Reflecting in front of your teachers and being vulnerable in front of them.</li>
<li>H/T to @ChrisWejr about 5 things to roar about blog posts.</li>
<li>Positive blog posts went from no big deal to students finding those positive events in the school.</li>
<li>Key elements to 5 things to roar about posts: celebrate success (student and staff successes) and give parents an idea of what learning looks like in our school.</li>
<li>What can we do to be a transformative principal? Mindset, tell the story of your school and do it wherever you are comfortable.</li>
<li>What reminds him about why he is doing this great work? For his own kids.</li>
