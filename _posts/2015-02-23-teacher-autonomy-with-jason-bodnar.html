After working with Assistant Superintendent on 1:1 initiative and creating his own classroom, he realized that he was able to see education in a different light, and chose to go into administration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a say in what is going on in your classroom can only lead to good things.</li>
<li>How he gives teachers autonomy in what they are doing.</li>
<li>Helping teaching find a way to try something new without fear of failure.</li>
<li>No matter how old you are, there are people older and younger that are smarter than you.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t like science, it is that the instruction you have had has not reached you.</li>
<li>What makes people great is having a knack for giving students a strong voice.</li>
<li>Differences between working with high school and middle school students and staff.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re trying new things and doing what&rsquo;s best for students, you&rsquo;re going to be successful.</li>
