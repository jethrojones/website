We have a teacher shortage. Things are too tough right now.</p> <p>I hear these things all the time! I recently talked with Dr. Melissa Sadin on the <a href= "https://resilientschools.com">Resilient Schools Podcast</a> about these challenges we are facing. How do we help our schools become resilient? Melissa talked about 2 things that are vital to our success.</p> <h2 id="hopebegetshope">Hope begets hope</h2> <p>If you talk about hope, you feel hopeful! That seems maybe too simplistic. But if you do a google scholar search for “<a href= "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=science+of+hope&amp;btnG=">science of hope</a>” you will find there is a lot out there to support this very simple idea: When you say the word hope, you feel hopeful.</p> <p>Is that really all we need to do? Just say it? Well, yes, it really is that simple. Melissa recommends having mini contests to see who can say the word hope the most! It makes a difference.</p> <h2 id="alaughadaykeepstheburnoutaway">A laugh a day keeps the burnout away</h2> <p>Melissa’s second suggestion was just as valuable. Laugh. I know, the “Live. Laugh. Love” signs are a bit overdone, but there is so much power in laughter.</p> <p>To make a complex topic extremely oversimplified, serotonin (also called the happy hormone) staves off anxiety and depression. There’s been some chatter on Twitter recently about SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) whose main goal is to increase serotonin levels in the brain.</p> <p>Just laughing is not the answer to everything, of course, but it is a simple thing to help. Melissa shared how teachers were sharing jokes with kids every day, and, of course, the kids thought the jokes were no good, so they started sharing their own. This laughter caused them all to be happier, more patient, and more importantly, more resilient.</p> <h2 id="whatisresilience">What is resilience?</h2> <p>Resilience is the ability to adapt and overcome challenges. That’s Melissa’s simplified definition after researching this topic for years. I believe in my core that if you can read, you can do just about anything in this world. However, if you can learn to adapt and overcome challenges, you will be more prepared for whatever life throws at you.</p> <h1 id="email">Email</h1> <p>In our podcast today, we are talking with Dr. Melissa Sadin, who has written a ton about trauma-informed practices.</p> <p>We talk specifically about the teacher shortage and what can be done about it.</p> <p>First, yes, teachers are struggling! So many are just trying to make it to the end of the year.</p> <p>Melissa’s advice is simple, though, just talk about hope and laugh.</p> <p>If that’s all you have time for today, say the word hope and laugh as much as you can. Can you say hope 25 times in a day?</p> <p>Just talking about it is enough to make us start feeling hopeful.</p> <p>Then, share jokes and laugh. Both of these things are incredibly powerful.</p> <p>Don’t just take my word for it, though. listen to the whole interview at https://resilientschools.com</p> <h1 id="video">Video</h1> <h1 id="twitterthread">Twitter Thread</h1> <p>How do we solve this tragic teacher shortage and burnout crisis we are in right now?</p> <p>First, we need to be come resilient. Resilience is the ability to adapt and overcome challenges. via @MelissaSadin</p> <p>Second, we need to have, talk about, and repeat hope. @MelissaSadin recommends having mini contests to see who can say the word hope the most!
