For the past eighteen months, I have worked in a school that has a large number of military-connected families.

I've learned a lot about people who join the military, and like most other people, they are good people at heart.

Like every other demographic you can think of, they want their kids to grow up and be successful adults.

The idea of going to war just isn't in my DNA, but I am grateful that other people have been willing to do that.

I hope that by serving these families daily in my school I can show my gratitude for their service not just today, but throughout the entire year.
