What is Synergy?

You'd probably call it project based learning. And that would be pretty accurate. But it's not exacly that.

Synergy is a time for students to learn without limitations. Synergy is a time when students bring all their skills and knowledge together to do something that leaves an impact.

I made a little video to explain it to my students, and I'd like to share it here.



What makes synergy so awesome? It's all driven by kids. They come up with the ideas. They do the work. Teachers are very much guides on the side supporting them. It's so exciting to see what kids are creating.

I'm working on a list that shows everything that kids are doing in Synergy, but it isn't quite done, yet. Kids are writing novels, making scale models of battleships, organizing a step team, finding ways help homeless youth, raising awareness about LGBT issues, decorating our school, writing uplifting messages on origami to give to others, upcycling, organizing after-school programs (sports and chess) for a neighboring school, creating a smoothie company, a locker decorations company, a vinyl decal company, and so much more.

I can't believe what I get to witness every week with these kids. Stay tuned for more to come about this exciting chapter in our school.
