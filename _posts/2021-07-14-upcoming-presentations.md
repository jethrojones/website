I've got a couple presentations coming up that you might be interested in. Two are virtual:

*How Student Driven Learning Is the Ultimate Instructional Strategy Before, During, and After a Pandemic. In this presentation I talk about how to implement student driven learning in your school. Register here: 
[NASSP National Principals Conference](https://www.principalsconference.org/register/)


*How to be a Transformative Principal. With the longest running educational leadership podcast out there, I've taken all my learnings from that and, as you probably know, am publishing webinars each month around the 12 key dispositions needed to be a Transformative Principal. This presentation is a small sampling of that information. Register here: 
[Learner First Virtual Summit.](https://www.firsteducation-us.com/first-summit-2021)

I'm also heading to Wisconsin and Kansas next month. If you're in those areas, I would love to connect if we can.
