Raised by educators, Melissa and Doug started the business in their garage in 1988, and they’ve been on a mission ever since to provide open-ended, inventive, non-technologically driven playthings for young children. Throughout Melissa’s remarkable career, she kept secret her lifelong battle with severe depression and anxiety. She reveals her struggles in LIFELINES, her first book, which she wrote to help others who are also suffering. Melissa’s book heralds the launch of <a href= "https://www.lifelines.com/">LifeLines.com</a>, an online ecosystem she and Doug are underwriting to support those seeking support, guidance, and community on their mental health journeys. Melissa lives in Connecticut with Doug and their six children.</p> <ul> <li>Why release it now.</li> <li>How was Melissa and Doug</li> <li>Nobody saw the creations I had made the first 20 years of my life.</li> <li>Overexcitabilities</li> <li>Think about tall the questions that are positive.</li> <li>Target let’s explore</li> <li>How to support kids who are struggling.</li> <li>Eggselent sheep book</li> <li>Kids Don’t know what makes their heart sing.</li> <li>From Creativity to self-expression</li> <li>Optimism means anything is possible.</li> <li>If it’s not ready, I don’t bring it.</li> <li>How to be atrnsformative principal?
