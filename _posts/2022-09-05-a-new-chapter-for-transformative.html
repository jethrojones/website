Eric will be recording the majority of the podcast episodes you hear over the next few months as we try a little experiment. We don’t know how it will work out, but we are hopeful.</p> <p>Each month, Jethro will have a coaching session with Eric that you will get to listen to see what a coaching session is really like, and to see how someone grows over the course of a school year.</p> <p>We’ll try this out and see how it goes. There are other episodes that Jethro has already recorded that will be coming out throughout the year as well, so you’ll still hear from Jethro.</p> <p>If you’d like to connect with Eric, he has an email at erik at transformativeprincipal.com or you can follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/emakelky">at emakelky</a></p> <p>Here are some things Eric is looking for support in this year:<br /> - Matching expectations with culture<br /> - Onboarding and supporting teachers new to the profession and new to the principal.<br /> - Building trust with families.</p> <p>Eric has a couple big goals for this year, too:<br /> - Measurable improvement on district goals.<br /> - Building trust<br /> - Defining the culture they want.</p> <h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2> <h3 id="transformativeprincipalmastermind"><a href= "https://transformativeprincipal.com">Transformative Principal Mastermind</a></h3> <p>Lead a school everyone can be proud of.</p> <p>Being a principal is tough work.
