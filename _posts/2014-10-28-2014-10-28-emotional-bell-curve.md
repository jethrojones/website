>On todays show we are talking about the Emotional Bell Curve and controlling your emotions.
  This topic was sparked by a recent temper tantrum I witnessed on the race track which resulted in a driver being kicked out of the championship race.  He lost his cool. He didn’t control his emotions.



I love having models to help guide my thinking in difficult situations. I don't know everything, so I appreciate having something to help me when the stakes are high.
