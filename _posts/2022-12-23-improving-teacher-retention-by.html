Eric has always had a passion for technology integration in the classroom, which led to him co-founding the EdTech company iAspire. Eric now hosts The Employee Experience in Education podcast where he speaks with educational leaders, former educators, and industry experts to better understand the employee experience in education. Eric’s goal is to equip school leaders with realistic and actionable strategies to keep more teachers in the classroom.</p> <p>Eric discusses how schools can improve teacher retention by focusing on the employee experience.&nbsp; By aligning the employer’s expectations, needs, and wants with those of the employee, schools can prevent turnover and retention in the classroom.&nbsp; The four principles of the employee experience are connection with themselves, connection with others, connection with their role, and connection with the organization.&nbsp; Happy teachers don’t quit!</p> <p><strong>Best way for listeners to reach out to Eric Bransteter:</strong>&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li><a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbransteter/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbransteter/</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2> <h3 id="pikmykid"><a href= "https://pikmykid.com/be">Pikmykid</a></h3> <p>Improve your school dismissal and safety response with&nbsp;<a href="https://pikmykid.com/be">Pikmykid, the Schools Safety and Dismissal Platform</a>.
