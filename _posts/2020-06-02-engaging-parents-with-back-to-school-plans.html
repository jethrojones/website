<p>When making school reopening plans, the need to involve parents is higher than ever.</p><p>If parents are not confident that you are going to keep their student safe from something that you cannot see or trace, they are likely not going to buy into your plan for reopening schools.</p><p>This tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/drsconstantino/status/1264251187437752324?s=21">@larryferlazzo</a> exemplifies what I'm talking about.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:null,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Screenshot 2020-06-02 06.47.39.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Screenshot 2020-06-02 06.47.39.png" title="Screenshot 2020-06-02 06.47.39.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6802ba82-bc21-4f6e-a383-69007b109ad9_1000x727.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>We have to make plans <em>with</em> parents! We can't just dictate to them what will happen.</p><p>In talking with a parent a couple weeks ago, she was sold on keeping her kids out of school this fall. She said she was fine teaching her kids on her own, but she didn't like having to use the teacher's plan (which sometimes were not thought out very well!</p><p>In our schools, we saw a drastic dropoff of parent and family engagement when they saw that our plans.</p><p>I'm determined to help you change that. In our <a href="https://gum.co/reopen">"Reopening Schools Workshop"</a> next week, we are going to outline a way to have parent involvement in the plan from the very beginning.</p><p>Here's the simple plan that we will help you work through:</p><ol><li><p>Make a list of 10 parents that can give you feedback</p></li><li><p>Call the parents and ask a simple question about what they need school to look like in the fall.</p></li><li><p>Take notes of their responses.</p></li></ol><p>This simple act of calling 10 parents will pay enormous dividends.</p><p>In our <a href="https://gum.co/reopen">workshop</a>, we will provide a proven script and role-plays to help you get through this process so you can really understand what they are saying.</p><p><a href="https://gum.co/reopen">Join us</a> to get help along the way so you're not figuring this out all on your own, only to be met with resistance in the fall.</p>
