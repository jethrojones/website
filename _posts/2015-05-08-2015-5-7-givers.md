William Parker:


>I guess the answers to those questions may depend on the teachers you ask. I would imagine many of them would speak to the intangibles that make teaching worth it. Like parenting, you don’t always show up because it’s required or even because you always like it; you do it because you believe it’s a calling.
  
  
Let’s shoot straight: it’s not easy to clean up spills on your classroom floor or break up a fight between angry boys and then turn right around and keep smiling while you teach essay writing, solve equations, or finish grading papers!



As always, thoughtful post from William Parker. Thank a teacher today.
