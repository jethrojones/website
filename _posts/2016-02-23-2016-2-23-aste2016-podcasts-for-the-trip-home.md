I had a great time this week at ASTE. I learned a lot and met some great people. I got lucky and was able to interview three of the four major presenters! You can subscribe to my podcast here: 
[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/transformative-principal/id770942472?mt=2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/transformative-principal/id770942472?mt=2)


The first interview was with 
[Carl Hooker](http://transformativeprincipal.org/carl-hooker). He gave a leadership session on Saturday that was all day long.


The second was with the great 
[Cory Doctorow](http://transformativeprincipal.org/cory-doctorow). He gave a keynote about the challenges we face in this digital age.


The third I actually interviewed before he came to ASTE, and that was with Frederick Lane 
[Episode 110](http://transformativeprincipal.org/episode110) and 
[Episode 111](http://transformativeprincipal.org/episode111). He talks about 
[Cybertraps for Educators](http://amzn.to/1K66RCC) and how to build health relationships.


Finally, 
[Damon Hargraves](http://twitter.com/DamonHargraves) and I presented on our schedule and app we created at the middle school. Here is the interview on 
[my podcast](transformativeprincipal.org/episode100) and on 
[Damon's](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/2-jethro-jones-on-rti-scheduling/id985508741?i=341906755&mt=2)


I hope as you travel home from ASTE, you can find some good information to deepen your learning from ASTE.
