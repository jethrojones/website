But we see that risk becomes somewhat constant or perhaps even declines after age 16,” said Elyse Thulin, a doctoral candidate at U-M’s School of Public Health, noting that more research is needed to understand the undercurrents of this decline.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Connected homes and the Internet of Things is increasing the potential for this type of behavior</li> <li>These types of behavior can cause or contribute to serious harm for victims, up to and including suicide</li> <li>Children can be perpetrators as well as victims</li> <li>Responses and Solutions <ul> <li>Statutory <ul> <li>Most states have amended their relevant statutes to include the use of electronic communications to commit these crimes</li> <li>Some states have adopted statutes specifically prohibiting cyberbullying, cyberharassment, and cyberstalking</li> <li>In some states, these behaviors can be either a misdemeanor or a felony</li> <li>With respect to speech, such statutes are a restriction of First Amendment freedoms and as such, are subject to strict scrutiny by the courts</li> <li>In some instances, courts have struck down language in these statutes on the grounds that the phrases or terms used are “unconstitutionally vague and overbroad” <ul> <li>Colorado: Supreme Court struck down phrase “intended to harass”</li> <li>Texas: Appellate court struck down a ban on online speech “intended to and reasonably likely to annoy”</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Corporate <ul> <li>Terms of Service</li> <li>Site Behaviors <ul> <li>Mute/Block</li> <li>Limiting Responses</li> <li>Unmentioning</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Litigation <ul> <li>Lawsuits seeking damages for intentional infliction of emotion distress, invasion of privacy, etc.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>From a 1975 decision by the Colorado Supreme Court: <ul> <li>Indeed, a fundamental purpose of free speech in our system of government is to debate ideas. These debates may be vigorous and high-minded but may at times devolve into vituperative attacks. “Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects.” But as the&nbsp;Bolles&nbsp;court aptly observed, if such speech could be restricted, “the protection of the First Amendment would be a mere shadow.”</li> </ul> </li> <li>Resources - #2022–04–11 Seeking to protect its users from cyberbullying, Twitter is experimenting with a feature to remove tags from mentions<br /> <a href= "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/424461">https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/424461</a><br />  - #2022–03–28 Colorado Supreme Court Strikes Down Electronic Harassment Ban<br /> <a href= "https://reason.com/volokh/2022/03/28/colorado-supreme-court-strikes-down-electronic-harassment-ban/"> https://reason.com/volokh/2022/03/28/colorado-supreme-court-strikes-down-electronic-harassment-ban/</a><br />  - #2022–02–11 ‘Your digital safety matters to us’: New campaign for protection against electronic harassment, blackmail [Egypt][https://dailynewsegypt.com/2022/02/11/your-digital-safety-matters-to-us-new-campaign-for-protection-against-electronic-harassment-blackmail/](https://dailynewsegypt.com/2022/02/11/your-digital-safety-matters-to-us-new-campaign-for-protection-against-electronic-harassment-blackmail/)<br />  - #2021–12–27 Cyberbullying Laws<br /> <a href= "https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/cyber-bullying.html"> https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/cyber-bullying.html</a><br />  - #2021–11–08 Electronic dating violence starts as early as 12<br /> <a href= "https://www.futurity.org/electronic-dating-violence-teenagers-2653102/"> https://www.futurity.org/electronic-dating-violence-teenagers–2653102/</a><br />  - #2021–11–04 E-violence increases through early adolescence but declines as teens become adults<br /> <a href= "https://news.umich.edu/e-violence-increases-through-early-adolescence-but-declines-as-teens-become-adults/"> https://news.umich.edu/e-violence-increases-through-early-adolescence-but-declines-as-teens-become-adults/</a><br />  - #2021–09–30 Two Toronto High School students facing charges in electronic harassment case<br /> <a href= "https://wtov9.com/news/local/two-toronto-high-school-students-facing-charges-in-electronic-harassment-case"> https://wtov9.com/news/local/two-toronto-high-school-students-facing-charges-in-electronic-harassment-case</a><br />  - #2019–08–22 Florida case reveals terrors of cyberstalking<br /> <a href= "https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/special/special-sections/2019/08/22/florida-case-reveals-terrors-cyberstalking/4407314007/"> https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/special/special-sections/2019/08/22/florida-case-reveals-terrors-cyberstalking/4407314007/</a><br />  - #2019–08–09 Texas Appellate Court Strikes Down Electronic Harassment Statute<br /> <a href= "https://reason.com/volokh/2019/08/09/texas-appellate-court-strikes-down-electronic-harassment-statute/"> https://reason.com/volokh/2019/08/09/texas-appellate-court-strikes-down-electronic-harassment-statute/</a><br />  - #2017–11–22 Boy, 13, charged with hate crime, electronic harassment after threats and ‘racial statements’<br /> <a href= "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-huntley-student-charged-with-hate-crime-for-threats-20171121-story.html"> https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-huntley-student-charged-with-hate-crime-for-threats–20171121-story.html</a><br />  - #2017–07–05 Ex-teacher pleads guilty to electronic harassment of high school student<br /> <a href= "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-teacher-electronic-harass-buffalo-grove-met-20170705-story.html"> https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-teacher-electronic-harass-buffalo-grove-met–20170705-story.html</a><br />  - #2014–04–15 Man pleads guilty to electronic harassment<br /> <a href= "https://www.news-gazette.com/news/man-pleads-guilty-to-electronic-harassment/article_a8b5a907-0b9a-58ac-8de5-be2ab4fd326c.html"> https://www.news-gazette.com/news/man-pleads-guilty-to-electronic-harassment/article_a8b5a907–0b9a–58ac–8de5-be2ab4fd326c.html</a><br />  - #2010–12–10 Billboard By Human Rights Activists Warns of Electronic Harassment<br /> <a href= "https://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/12/prweb4881944.htm">https://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/12/prweb4881944.htm</a></li> </ul> <br /><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/cybertraps/Cybertraps_122_Can_we_stop_cyberharassment.mp3?dest-id=2561582">Check out this episode!</a></p>
