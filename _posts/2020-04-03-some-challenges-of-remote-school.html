<p>Have you ever noticed that kids are different at home with their families than they are at school?</p><p>You know that parent who comes in and no matter what you tell them, they’ll say, “Well, that’s not how she acts at home!”</p><p>Now, parents are in the unenviable position of working with their kids day after day!</p><p>My kids are of the “fighters at home/angels at school“ variety.</p><p>Others are angels at home and hellions at school. And there’s everything in between.</p><p>My own kids do great in school.</p><p>Some kids struggle mightily at school, but are great at home.</p><p>Regardless of where kids lie on that spectrum, they’re home now, and doing schoolwork that someone else is assigning, and parents are trying their best to manage.</p><p>While trying to help my 2nd grader with a 13 page (26+questions) Google Form quiz, I experienced the frustration that can come from these challenges.</p><p>In case you’re wondering, yes, that ended in tears (and an incomplete test).</p><p>I won’t say whose tears they were to protect the innocent.</p><p>What exactly is the purpose of school right now?</p><p>Is it structure? Is a teacher providing structure in a family’s home really a good idea right?</p><p>Is it “moving forward on standards”? Is moving forward on standards really worth it right now?</p><p>Is it “giving kids time to explore their passions”?</p><p>Honestly, I don’t have a solution to this, but I hope that I am doing a good enough job as a school leader to not add additional stressors to the families I serve that are forced to stay around each other 24/7 for who knows how long!</p>
