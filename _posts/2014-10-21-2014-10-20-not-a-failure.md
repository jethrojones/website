>But I knew I wasnâ€™t a failure - it was just that no one took the time to find out what I was interested in; what I was excited about; and what I was passionate about in "real life."



I know that I was a struggling student. Not because I wasn't smart, but because school did not hold my interest. I figured out "the game" I needed to play and worked hard at doing just enough to scrape by.


Many educators, myself included, assume that people are teachers because they were good students. I think there is now a growing number of educators who realized they could do it better than their teachers and connect with kids that our traditional system can't connect to.
