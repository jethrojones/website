On the one hand, students liked using the iPad to house their textbooks and suggested it promoted more reading. <b>[I&#39;d venture that they could read more because they were actually able to have their books with them at a time when they otherwise wouldn&#39;t]</b> On the other hand, reactions from the beginning-of-the-semester expectations of planned use to the end-of-the-semester actual use saw e-book reading exhibiting the greatest change, a substantial decrease. Students thought they would use the iPad as an e-reader but did not do so as much as initially planned.</em></p></blockquote>What was said later about pedagogy needing to change with technology was spot on:<br />Â <br /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;"> &quot;...technology, pedagogy and curriculum each have influence on the other. If you&#39;re not able to modify your teaching methods or curriculum to take account of new technology, that&#39;s a barrier to getting the maximum utilisation out of these devices.&quot;<br /></blockquote><br />If the iPad-as-textbook is just the textbook loaded into iBooks, with nothing else changed, the iPad is no better for reading than a textbook; it is probably a worse reading experience (with the <i>only</i> benefit being that the iPad is lighter than a textbook). <p /> If the textbook is just a PDF opened in Noterize or PDFNotes, then it is already much better, as those two programs are designed for annotating a PDF. <p />If the textbooks are in something like Inkling, where there are additional multimedia supports (videos, pictures, interactive images, etc.) then it is even better. <p /> It is probably best when the book adapts to the new technology like the book &quot;Our Choice&quot;, which clearly appears to be the best &quot;book&quot; reading experience on the iPad. <p />I hope the image explains it better than I could.</div>
