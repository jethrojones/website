Todd Nesloney:


>Listed below are 13 people I learn from quite often, that many of my blog readers probably haven't heard about!  So I've decided to introduce you to them, so that you can learn from them as much as I do!  So give them a follow, send them a tweet, and join in on learning together!



My favorite thing about this list is that I only know one of them. Adding people to my PLN is awesome. Thanks Todd!
