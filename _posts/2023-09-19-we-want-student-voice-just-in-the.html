<p>While popular culture, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpqmQJXdqrM">Jay Leno's Jaywalking series</a>, may poke fun at the average American's lack of civic knowledge, the reality is that our educational institutions are not doing enough to foster a true understanding of democracy. This is further exacerbated by the limited scope of student participation in decision-making processes within schools.</p><p>While it's easy to laugh at the participants in Jaywalking, the truth is that many of us would falter with a microphone in our faces and Jay Leno hovering so closely. This isn't just a reflection of individual ignorance; it's indicative of a systemic issue. Our schools, which are supposed to be the breeding grounds for informed citizens, often fall short in teaching the essence of democracy.</p><p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://nsba.org/ASBJ/2023/october/democracy-in-action">article from the National School Boards Association</a>&nbsp;echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of student voice to demonstrate democracy in action. However, the reality in nearly every school is that students are subjected to authoritarian rule, with no avenue for escape. Take, for example, my own experience of being put in charge of a student council group. The district wanted student participation, but only within the boundaries they had set. The students wanted to build camaraderie amongst the four high schools by hosting a district dance. But the district would have none of it.</p><p>The Assistant Superintendent said to me, "Jethro, of course we want the kids to have a voice, we just want them to have a voice in the way that we want them to have a voice. They don't get to come with ideas, they need to respond to the ideas we bring to them." This is not democracy; it's authoritarianism.</p><p></p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;929fb781-d4f1-4923-8219-50f3d225b804&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>David K Richards, in his podcast&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-k-richards-a1b43753_educationrevolution-mindsetmatters-learningjourney-activity-7107799439347482626-D_bw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">ChangeMaker EDU</a>, further elaborates on this paradox. Even when schools attempt to adopt democratic or student-led approaches, they often revert to authoritarian models. This is not just counterproductive; it's detrimental to the very idea of teaching democracy. How can we expect students to understand the nuances of democratic governance when their firsthand experience is anything but? It's like trying to teach someone to ride a bike by merely showing them pictures and never letting them feel the wind in their hair as they pedal down a street.</p><p>In summary, the issue is not just about individual lapses in civic knowledge, as amusingly highlighted by Jay Leno's Jaywalking. It's about a systemic failure to instill the principles of democracy through our educational institutions. If we are serious about fostering a society that values democratic ideals, we need to start by re-evaluating the way we engage students in our schools. We need to move beyond controlled participation and authoritarian tendencies to create environments where democracy is not just taught but lived. Only then can we expect the next generation to be truly informed and active participants in a democratic society.</p>
