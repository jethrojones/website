---Across all 8 models, I can calculate which schools most consistently showed greater, or lesser “growth” on state assessments than predicted, given their students and resource levels. While I could have applied trickier statistical models – stochastic frontier, etc. – these really don’t change the rankings that much.  And that’s what I’ve done to generate the following list of the “Top 50 productive efficient schools in New Jersey.” Notably absent here are any schools that serve only upper grades and thus have not growth percentile measure to model.
