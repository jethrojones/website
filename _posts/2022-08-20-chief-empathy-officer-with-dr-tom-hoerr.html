You can make it stronger<br /> - intentional and transparent<br /> - Voluntary - making it voluntary is having empathy.<br /> - listening, aggressive, pursuing.<br /> - One of your problems - you look too busy.<br /> - I was working; I was being accessible.<br /> - Who are you closest to in your school.<br /> - Even if my idea is the best, it’s not the best if nobody is on board.<br /> - Breakfast with Tom - agenda is yours.<br /> - Empathetic Conversations - extension of this notion that I really want to get to know people as people, not just teachers.<br /> - I know you as a student, I want to know you as a student<br /> - Leadership is about relationship.<br /> - Teacher observations - school principals should use them as a way to build trust and observations.<br /> - Educators are underpaid.<br /> - <a href= "https://www.simplypsychology.org/herzbergs-two-factor-theory.html"> Herzberg’s theory of motivation</a><br /> - Teaching is far too siloed<br /> - If people can just read one part of the book, what is it?
