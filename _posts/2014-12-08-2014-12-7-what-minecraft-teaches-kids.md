>Love or hate Minecraft, kids obsess over it, playing huddled over iPads or eyes fixated on monitors and televisions. The premise is almost rudimentary: Minecraft is an open-ended “sandbox” game where you construct and play in elaborate worlds. Some kids recreate famous pieces of architecture, others express their creativity through grand designs, but the experience is simple: in the free-form Minecraft sandbox, you can build practically anything your imagination can think up.
