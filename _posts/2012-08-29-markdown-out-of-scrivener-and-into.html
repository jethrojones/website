<p>In writing my <a href="http://paperlessprincipal.com">book</a>, I used Markdown as I was writing it to force me to focus on the content, or else I would never get it done. I didn&#8217;t start playing around with fonts, and colors, and design until the actual writing was in to be reviewed by a trusted friend. </p>

<p>I had a really hard time getting the Markdown text out of Scrivener into a readable format with the pictures that I had linked in. I needed the format to go to Word so that I could insert chapters into iBooks Author. </p>

<p>When I compiled from Scrivener to Word, I got markdown formatted text, not RTF (and no pictures)</p>

<p>When I compiled from Scrivener to RTF, I got rich text, formatted how I wanted, but without pictures. </p>

<p>When I compiled from Scrivener to PDF, I got rich text, formatted how I wanted, with pictures, but when I copied and pasted it, the pictures all went to the last ten pages, which would have required more work than I wanted. </p>

<p>When I compiled from Scrivener to TXT, it gave me just what I had written in Scrivener. </p>

<p>When I exported to OPML, I got a really cool <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/1T151w2Y1W0A0w1J1F2g/PaperlessPrincipalOPML.png">Mind Map of my whole book</a>!</p>

<p>To get what I needed, I had to go to and download the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">Drag and Drop apps</a> (all the way at the bottom) from <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/2012/05/multimarkdown_3.6">Fletcher Penney&#8217;s</a> github site. When I did that, I dragged my Scrivener-exported .txt file onto the HTML app, and it converted it to HTML for me. I opened that up and copied the styled text from the web browser, and pasted it into a Word doc. It got all the formatting how I set it up in Markdown, and made it easy for me to get it out into chapters to be imported into iBooks Author. </p>

<p>I realize now that I could have compiled from Scrivener to HTML and been totally fine with what I needed. Live and learn, right?</p>

<p>As a side note, I really like iBooks Author. It makes even what I am doing look fairly decent!</p>

<p>Have a Good Life.</p>
