Here is a video in two parts that this college (<a href="http://www.acu.edu/technology/mobilelearning/index.html">Abilene Christian University</a>) produced called "Connected."<br /><br /> <object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Tp8fHgp0xhU&rel=1&border=0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Tp8fHgp0xhU&rel=1&border=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"width="425" height="355"></embed></object><br /><br />The funniest part is that it is playing the video on the iPhone is not shown in widescreen! Classic. Just goes to show that not only is this a crappy way to get people to come to your school, but it also shows that not everyone is on board with this, which is how it has to work if it is to succeed. <br /><br />The other thing that is hilarious about this is that they totally overlook (at least in this video) any educational possibilities that exist for the iPhone/iTouch. <br /><br />"This new iPhone is so great, it shows me how to get to class late on my first day! Thanks, ACU!"<br /><br />The video is actually pretty funny, and makes me want one for each of my students even less. I guess it shows that maybe my dreams won't really happen because then we would all be dorks. Thanks ACU!<br /><br />Have a Good Life.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TLCTpX3tJEQ"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/TLCTpX3tJEQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>
