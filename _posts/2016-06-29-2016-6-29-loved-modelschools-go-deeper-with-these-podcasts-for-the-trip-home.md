If you, like me loved, the Model Schools Conference, you’re going to love these podcasts.


For listening to podcasts, I’d recommend 
[Overcast](https://appsto.re/us/jhe90.i) for iPhone or 
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict) for Android.


Here are some of the podcasts that I’ve recorded with some presenters from #modelschools:


[Bill Daggett](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/?s=Bill+daggett)


[Sue Szachowicz](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/?s=Sue+Szachowicz)


[Eric Sheninger](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/?s=Eric+Sheninger)


[Rob Carroll](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/?s=Rob+Carroll)


[Kyle Palmer](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/?s=Kyle+Palmer)


Also, if you want to take your leadership to the next level, check out the 
[Transformative Leadership Summit](https://gc319.isrefer.com/go/tls/jethrojones/blog%20/), the #1 Online Leadership Conference focused exclusively on K–12 school leaders and teachers.
