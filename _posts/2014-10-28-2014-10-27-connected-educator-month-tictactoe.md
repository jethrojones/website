The always creative Melinda Miller:


>In your mailbox you will find a Tic Tac Toe grid for Connected Educator Month. Last year you could fill out the Bingo card in the spring semester. Tic Tac Toe should be a little easier to complete for more people:) Once you complete your game board turn it in the to the office you can choose your FREE doodie! If you "black out" the whole card you can cash in for a FREE doodie AND 1 hour lunch coupon. Your class will be covered a 1/2 hour before or after lunch!
