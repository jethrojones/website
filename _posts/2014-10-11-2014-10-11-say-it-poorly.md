“The first step is to say it poorly. And then say it again and again and again until you're able to edit your words into something that works.”


This quote from Seth Godin ties in nicely with 
[Tom Whitford's "Reboot"](http://www.jethrojones.com/blog/2014/10/10/reboot-via-tom-whitford). What matters is that we wrote or communicate, even if it is not great at the beginning. I struggle with this myself.
