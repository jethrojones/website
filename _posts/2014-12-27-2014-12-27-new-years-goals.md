Dr. Spike Cook:


>Still looking for the New Year’s resolution (or change, plan, etc)? Before you jump into the change you want to make, take a look at what you were able to accomplish in 2014.
   
  Take a few minutes (might take longer) and go through your calendar, twitter feed, or Facebook timeline. Using your Social Networks makes it easy to scroll through the highlights (and low lights). Facebook even has a feature that will make a short flip for you or you can customize it.
   
  I accomplished some of my goals in 2014, and didn't accomplish others. I changed some midyear when I realized I didn't want to do that. My health and spiritual goals were the least successful, and those are probably the worst to get wrong!
