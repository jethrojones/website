One of the new podcasts (I guess 94 episodes isn't really new) that I really like is the 
[EdAdmin Minute](http://edreach.us/channel/ed-admin/) on the EdReach Network. What I really like about this podcast is that Chris' comments are short and sweet and to the point. No matter how busy you are, you can make time for 2 minutes each day. I can usually finish an episode before I back out of the driveway.


[@ChrisLAtkinson](http://twitter.com/chrislatkinson) was kind enough to let me be on his podcast this weekend. We went a little longer than what he usually does, so this one is 5 minutes instead of the usual one minute. It was a good interview. Give it a listen and let me know what you think:
