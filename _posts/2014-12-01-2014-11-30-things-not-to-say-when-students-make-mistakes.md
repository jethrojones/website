>As with parenting, learning from mistakes is required in the classroom.  I agree with a powerful blog written by 
[Dr. Curwin](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/use-mistakes-in-learning-process-richard-curwin) that emphasizes mistakes are a springboard for learning.  I began thinking about my own experiences with students and mistake-making.  Sometimes, I feel that I do get it right, but there are many times that I don't.  I was inspired by Dr. Curwin's list of suggestions and wanted to contribute.  I thought it would be helpful to start with the mistakes that we as teachers make in talking to students about their mistakes. 



What I like about this article is that it is not so much about what not to say, as it is about what kind of attitudes don't help the learning through mistakes process.
