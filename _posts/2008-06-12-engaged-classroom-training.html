I just completed the Engaged Classroom training: a four-day course that covered a book and a bunch of social/web tools. It was pretty intense, and I think that a lot of people are overwhelmed. Below is a picture of the stuff that we got (I used <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library 2</a> to get that all organized).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCmDKfN7cVplgZ8w4QNQMhZFUpky_96rrFFguV8TkuHr1m8XiCXLTmqS1Ew-0ZUZ74AMc3l0X7DftA22EwYRa8KJrvxj8VhE01IfYm7j1315eAtiwvbDDWDyFvmZGxE6qyiJ1v6ziwfT-C/s1600-h/stuff.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCmDKfN7cVplgZ8w4QNQMhZFUpky_96rrFFguV8TkuHr1m8XiCXLTmqS1Ew-0ZUZ74AMc3l0X7DftA22EwYRa8KJrvxj8VhE01IfYm7j1315eAtiwvbDDWDyFvmZGxE6qyiJ1v6ziwfT-C/s400/stuff.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5211124666455683810" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I am so excited to do this. I have the tools now to do stuff. That has been the biggest hurdle for me.<br /><br />I am required to train two other teachers to use these tools: <a href="http://shakehistoryclass.blogspot.com/">Matt</a> and <a href="http://mlesueur.wordpress.com/">Melinda</a>. Matt is a self-proclaimed technophobe, but he is coming along. I think my biggest challenge with him is the actual implementation of the tools. I think that if I work with him over the summer, he will be good to go. He just needs to start using these tools.<br /><br />Melinda is pretty savvy, and I think she will need direction to find what is good for her class. She is still new, and teaches a heavy curriculum, but I think that she will come along nicely, as well.<br /><br />The best thing is that I really like both of them. Matt and Melinda are awesome, and I am very lucky that I get to teach with them. They are both very accommodating, eager to learn, and flexible. I am really looking forward to this Engaged Classroom program.<br /><br />The biggest concern that I have is the time that it will take to teach the students to use these tools. Some of them will "get it" and some won't. Some will be so engrossed I will have to pry the technology away from them, and some won't care at all.<br /><br />I think the key is to make sure that I am not forcing them to use the tools, but making an environment that will be conducive to them learning with a lot of failures will be crucial. I think I am up to the task.<br /><br />This is not going to be an easy thing to do, but it will be worth it, I think.<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
