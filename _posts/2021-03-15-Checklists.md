In working with a coaching client today, he asked me, "Why don't you make me a full checklist person?"Â 

I said, "If you really wanted to be a checklist kind of person, you would be already. I can't make you anything. My job is to help you find your strengths and figure out what works for you!"

My goal when working with people is not to make them into something they're not. My goal is to help them become the best version of themselves.
