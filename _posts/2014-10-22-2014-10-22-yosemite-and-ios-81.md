Austin Mann:


>It’s now super easy to slow down your iPhone Slo-Mo footage on your Mac: just open the slow-motion video file in QuickTime and drag the sliders on the timeline below. This process will be familiar as it’s exactly the same as the process on your iPhone.



While he is talking about how these are benefits for photographers, I think they are benefits for everyone who uses an iPhone.


I wonder if some of these new features that keep all our devices in sync will be a detriment to me because I am on a metered Internet package now.
