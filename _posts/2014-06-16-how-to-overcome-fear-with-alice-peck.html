In this episode we focus on her new assignment as a principal of a Title I school in our district.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Alice going to take with her to her new Title I school?</li>
<li>What is Alice anxious about in going to her new school?</li>
<li>Why Alice is excited about change.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not nervous, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this!&rdquo;</li>
<li>How Alice is going to overcome her fears.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The greatest way to overcome fear is to face it and address it!&rdquo;</li>
<li>How Alice will deal with building trust as fast as she can. Hint: you can&rsquo;t speed up trust.</li>
<li>The importance of visibility as a school leader.</li>
<li>Modeling the kind of work ethic she wants her staff to have.</li>
<li>What advice does Alice have to be a transformative principal? Surround yourself with smart people.</li>
<li>What helps Alice focus on what is most important? (I forgot to take a picture before I left her office! I&rsquo;ll see if you can send me one.)</li>
</ul>
