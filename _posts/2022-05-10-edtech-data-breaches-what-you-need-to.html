The intrusion, which lasted until January 8, 2022, compromised the private data of nearly one million students in New York State (and maybe more)<br /> - The breach affected at least 24 school districts and 18 charter schools, along with one Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES)<br /> - The company initially described the hack as an “attempted security incident” but then shut down both Skedula and PupilPath for more than a week to address the issue<br /> - Possibly the largest school data breach in U.S. history<br /> - What Is Illuminate Education?<br /> - A California-based edtech company (founded in 2009) that runs a variety of school information platforms, including Skedula (aka IO Classroom), PupilPath, and eduCLIMBER<br /> - From its website:<br /> - Our solution brings together holistic data and collaborative instructional tools, and puts them in the hands of educators.<br /> - As a result, they can visualize each student’s progress, determine the right instructional or intervention strategy, and take the best next action, moment-by-moment.<br /> - More than 17 million students and 5,200 districts and schools across all 50 states rely on Illuminate every day to move the student performance needle.<br /> - It does not have a NY state- or city-wide contract but it is an approved vendor, which means that it was “rigorously reviewed” by the IT Department for the state Department of Education<br /> - Schools use the platforms for a variety of purposes:<br /> - tracking grades and attendance<br /> - communicating with parents<br /> - contact tracing for COVID–19<br /> - The company has earned about $5 million per year from NY schools<br /> - What Data Was Compromised?<br /> - A database containing a variety of personally identifying information, including:<br /> - names<br /> - birthdays<br /> - ethnicities<br /> - home languages<br /> - student ID numbers of current and former public school students going back to the 2016–17 school year<br /> - identities of special ed students<br /> - class and teacher schedules<br /> - identities of those receiving free lunch<br /> - Post-Incident Responses<br /> - Illuminate waited two months to formally notify the city<br /> - Avoid bad publicity and/or litigation<br /> - Negotiating with hackers<br /> - Avoid compromising investigation<br /> - Illuminate claimed that all student data is encrypted but the breach revealed that was not true<br /> - New York state law requires that student information be encrypted both “at rest or in motion”<br /> - The hack is still being investigated by the Dept. of Education, the New York Police Department, the FBI, and NYS Attorney General Leticia James<br /> - A school district in Connecticut also reported a breach, as did at least two in Colorado<br /> - New York State Education Department drafted a template for a letter/web page for parents<br /> - Notification of “unauthorized release of such data”<br /> - Notification of number of years of data affected (blank in template)<br /> - A promise that more information will be provided<br /> - What Are the Risks?<br /> - Profound impact on the ability of schools to function<br /> - Identity Theft using dark web tools and resources<br /> - Credit damage to minors, who typically don’t monitor their credit<br /> - What Can Schools Do?<br /> - Make sure that their own house is in order<br /> - Updated security patches<br /> - Collaboration with other schools/districts<br /> - Ongoing review and utilization of state and federal resources<br /> - Consider bringing in outside security consultants<br /> - Review what student data is collected and whether doing so is mission-critical<br /> - Don’t just collect data because it is possible to do so<br /> - Make local backups of any data that is being transmitted to third-party vendors<br /> - Thoroughly vet third-party vendors who collect and store student data<br /> - Have they had security or data breach issues in the past?<br /> - Advocate for stronger regulation of data collection firms at both state and federal levels<br /> - What Can Parents Do?<br /> - Don’t ignore notices of potential data breaches<br /> - Change any passwords used by you or your children to interact with the school or the vendor platform(s)<br /> - Put a credit lock on child social security numbers<br /> - Take advantage of offers for complimentary credit monitoring for themselves and their children<br /> - Be wary of possible fraud – scam calls, phishing emails, etc.<br /> - Double-check by phone with school personnel about any online request for information<br /> - Talk to your children about possible misuse of their information<br /> - The price of digital data is eternal vigilance<br /> - Resources<br /> - [n.d.] Illuminate Education<br /> <a href= "https://www.illuminateed.com/">https://www.illuminateed.com/</a><br />  - [n.d.] New York State Education Department Template for Breach Notification Letter<br /> <a href= "http://www.nysed.gov/data-privacy-security/illuminate-education-breach-notice"> http://www.nysed.gov/data-privacy-security/illuminate-education-breach-notice</a><br />  -
