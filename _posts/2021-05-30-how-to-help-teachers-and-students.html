He is a founding senior partner of the Instructional Coaching Group and a research associate at the University of Kansas Center for Research on Learning. His book <em>Instructional Coaching: A Partnership Approach to Improving Instruction</em> (Corwin, 2007) popularized the idea of instructional coaching. Knight’s other books include <em>Focus on Teaching: Using Video for High-Impact Instruction</em> (Corwin, 2014) and <em>Better Conversations: Coaching Ourselves to Be More Credible, Caring, and Connected</em>. <em>The Impact Cycle</em>, released in 2017.<br /> * Just survival is a big deal, so don’t overlook that.<br /> * Don’t lose sight of getting through it.<br /> * Express compassion and support and let people know we are there for them.<br /> * Coaches can have three things they can do<br /> * Mentor: giving people resources<br /> * Trainer: helping people learn things<br /> * Coaching: Goal you’re trying to hit.<br /> * You can’t cut coaching and still have coaching. It becomes a question of priority.<br /> * Here’s why people should keep coaching going.<br /> * Once I set a goal that really matters to me as a teacher…<br /> * Grounded in real life application.<br /> * Practice won’t happen by chance.<br /> * Video peer coaching<br /> * Principals can take a coaching approach, but the really deep implementation of learning is hard to do without a coach<br /> * outcome is what is going to have the greatest impact on children’s outcome.<br /> * Identify a change they made that really made a difference.<br /> * Unless I care about the goal, compliance is the best you’ll get.<br /> * Without the follow up you won’t get the desired outcome.<br /> * It’s ok for people in the organization to have different goals.<br /> * If what you’re doing is working, keep doing it.<br /> * Transparent and honest conversation about what’s happening. You need to face reality.<br /> * What will be different, and how will we measure it?<br /> * I don’t see myself as trying to get teachers to do something.<br /> * Put systems in place so teachers can excel.<br /> * If they don’t have a say, they’re not going to be committed to it.<br /> * It’s messy. It’s not as simple as I describe it.<br /> * Dealing with people is a really complex thing.<br /> * We sometimes grab on to a quick solution.<br /> * The book whisperer.<br /> * The issue is power.<br /> * How to be a transformative principal?
