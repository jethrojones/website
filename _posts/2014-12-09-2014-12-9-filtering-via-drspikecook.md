Dr. Spike Cook:


>In hindsight, I wish that someone would have taken the time to read the magazine with me, or better yet use it as a learning experience for projects including math, LAL, science, physical education or social studies. Nope. Put it away or I will confiscate it. Sometimes when I hear about (I even experience it as a Principal) the web filtering and blocking of sites it makes me think back to those days in the 1980s. Sometimes there is such a disconnect between students, teachers and learning.



What is even more frustrating is that when we filter things, we sometimes make it a lot harder for teachers to actually teach kids. That is frustrating. 
[Damon Hargraves](http://twitter.com/damonhargraves) often says that we mess up a perfectly good computer and make it less useful when we add some filtering or management software to it.
