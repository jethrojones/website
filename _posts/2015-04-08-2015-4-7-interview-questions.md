'Tis the season. Shawn Blankenship:


>I have been in administration for 10 years and I have been asked by many to share my interview questions. I decided to take a moment to provide just a few questions that reveal much more about a candidate than just how skilled he/she is at interviewing.



We have a couple positions available at my school and have started interviewing. I enjoy and despise interviewing. Having great questions really makes a difference in how the interview goes.


My favorite recent addition to our questions is: "What do you do about the kids you can't reach?"
