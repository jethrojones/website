Due to a grant by our PTSA, I was able to purchase 3 iPod Touches for use in my classroom. I was going to do some  unboxing pics, but I was too busy watching Heroes last night to worry about totally geeking out. But, I did get a chance to snap a picture of the three iPods.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjf8pJdQFpNpOfbrm5xElpUtRJHXfkMpPcL45NhbICj-ruvqzB380BVS4mLL7H0syBGHJ3uXpH51WcQL_rbTDzlGKOSlP2hOe524UGchQiY-n4pltTUw1RVi-50s5o3RCIwX4Imfe_ABXCX/s1600-h/Photo+8.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjf8pJdQFpNpOfbrm5xElpUtRJHXfkMpPcL45NhbICj-ruvqzB380BVS4mLL7H0syBGHJ3uXpH51WcQL_rbTDzlGKOSlP2hOe524UGchQiY-n4pltTUw1RVi-50s5o3RCIwX4Imfe_ABXCX/s400/Photo+8.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5249312557765193266" border="0" /></a><br />Last school year, I talked about my dream of having these in the classroom. I still think it is a good idea, and I think that it will be beneficial for my students.<br /><br />I bought a bunch of applications, though most of them were free. I have a few that I have been thinking of writing myself (shh, don't tell my wife, she thinks I have too much on my plate already) but I probably won't ever get to it, because it takes so much time to learn something so new to me.<br /><br />The cool thing is that the kids love it. They would do any assignment I asked of them, just because it is on an iPod. So, where does that leave me?<br /><br />Here is my philosophy: I don't know what it is yet.<br /><br />I am bouncing around a few things.<br /><ol><li>Students should use technology to do things that they would do anyways. For example, my students do a quickwrite every so often. Today, they entered their quickwrites in a form on our wiki and all their stories are in a spreadsheet on Google Docs. </li><li>Students should use technology to do new things that they haven't done before. In other words, this should change the way I teach and the way they learn. For example, I made a video and put it on the iTouches for them to watch, and they received instruction by watching a video so that they could perform their next task.<br /></li><li>Students should use technology so that they are engaged and that is the only reason why.<br /></li></ol>I am amazed at how my students have reacted to the technology in our classroom. They love it. They are much more willing to do what I ask when they get to use technology.<br /><br />I enjoy their enthusiasm for the technology, because it is something I share, also.<br /><br />Will you help me clarify my philosophy about technology?<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
