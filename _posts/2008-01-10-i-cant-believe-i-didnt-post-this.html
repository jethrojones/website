We <a href="http://twentyfivedays.wordpress.com/2007/12/25/drumroll-please-announcing-the-winners/">won</a>!!! We had a great time doing the activities for the Freerice.com marathon and making our Wiki. Here are some pictures of the activities:<br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jethro.jones/FreeRice/photo#5153940787208353874"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/jethro.jones/R4Z51tbzeFI/AAAAAAAAAZM/DLENHxgAkMU/s144/PC190015.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jethro.jones/FreeRice/photo#5153940830158026898"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/jethro.jones/R4Z54NbzeJI/AAAAAAAAAZs/QZqlf_v2BmU/s144/PC190022.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jethro.jones/FreeRice/photo#5153940843042928802"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jethro.jones/R4Z549bzeKI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/FlfBKFgT8wc/s144/PC190023.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><br />The SWAT team wiki has turned out to be an amazing experience. Students are much more excited about doing work at home. Also, we now have 16 pages on the wiki with over 300 revisions of the pages. It is very interesting to see how much they use it. I plan on using it more in the next quarter. There will be a <a href="http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/Learning+Centers">learning center assignment </a>due where about 60 kids will be using the wiki to track results of the <a href="http://campaigntrailcollaboration.wikispaces.com/Super+Tuesday%21">Super Tuesday</a>. I am pretty excited about it and I hope it will go well. I will post more after we get the video call with the NASA scientists. Wish us luck.
