I just joined a website called bookcrossing.com. I found out about it through the BzzAgent.com frogpond. It is basically like geocaching, but with books. You place books at different places around you and you can find other books that people left as well. If anyone has any experience with this, let me know.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.bzzagent.com//p/4896356844/arthurjmcdougal">Visit Book Crossing</a>
