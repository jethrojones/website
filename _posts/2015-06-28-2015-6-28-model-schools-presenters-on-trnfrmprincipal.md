There are some great presenters at the 
[Model Schools Conference](http://modelschoolsconference.com) this week in Atlanta, Georgia. If you are here, and want to hear more from the some of the presenters, I have interviewed a few of them for the 
[Transformative Principal podcast](http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/rss).
