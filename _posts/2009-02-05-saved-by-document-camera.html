My wife has been having pain in her jaw for the last week or so, and the only way I could convince her to go see the doctor is if I came home from work and went with her. She scheduled an appointment for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-04-16-yeah-im-pretty-good-at-that %}">a day</a> that I don't want to miss from work. So, I decided that I would take advantage of the Document Camera that we have and have a little fun at the same time.<br /><br /><object id="BLOG_video-b34e9dead845f7b0" class="BLOG_video_class" width="320" height="266" contentid="b34e9dead845f7b0"></object><br /><br /><div>I recorded myself teaching the students about persuasive writing while I taught it in the morning classes. That way, when I left, the substitute could just press play and I would be able to sleep at night knowing that my students got the information I need them to. This video is just the beginning part. The rest of the videos will be posted online soon enough. I am actually pretty excited because it will be fun to be able to use this again next year for a refresher course for me. The students responded very well to it. I almost want to do this every day. I could just record my direct instruction, and then I wouldn't have to repeat myself so much every day. Also, it ensures that all my students get the same message. Even though I may be sick of hearing myself over and over again at the end of the day, it will be new to my students each period, and I won't have to do anything different to keep myself from getting bored. This is one thing that I want all my students to understand completely, and it is really good for them all to hear the exact same thing and see it done the exact same way.Â </div><br />Have a Good Life.
