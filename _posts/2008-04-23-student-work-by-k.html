<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> My student just came to me with her addition, a couple lines at the bottom, in red.<br /><br />My student wrote this poem for an assignment with very little instruction: You need to write a poem that is at least 20 lines long and then tell me what the main idea of the poem is and tell me what emotions you are using or feeling in the poem.<br /><br />I present it here with no editing, and it will annoy me to death, but that is how she explicitly wanted it. I tell my students (especially in poetry) that it is okay to break the rules as long as 1) you know what rule you are breaking and 2) you know why you are breaking it. She knew the what and why, so here it is:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Many people say I hate my life,<br /></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Why can't someone else be in my</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">place? Why not live life while you're</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">alive! Think, do you want to be some </span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">helpless cat dead on the sidewalk. As you</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">see, lightning is most peoples' killer anger. It roars</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">to life &amp; it stays for a while. If </span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">you die, many people feel sorry for you, but</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">isn't death what you wanted? So death is </span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">what you got! Once you die or kill your-</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">self there are no second chances, you feel </span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">angry &amp; stupid for wanting to die all</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">you do now is sit down &amp; <span style="font-style: italic;">cry</span>! <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">You wish<br />u hadn't but you did, now u wish you<br />still had lived. There are so many things<br />in life to live for so step back and try to<br />ignore. People want to bring you down<br />just look at them and frown, frown, frown.<br />You will be a clown if you want to die<br />So don't do it just sit &amp; cry, cry, cry.<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Your life is over, it was your choice you </span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">shouldn't have killed yourself, instead spoke</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">your voice.</span><br /></span></span></blockquote>I think it is a pretty good poem, and I like that it has an anti-suicide message. This girl has always bewildered me, and I like that she is showing herself in this poem.<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
