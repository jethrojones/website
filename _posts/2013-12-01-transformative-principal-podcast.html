After much contemplation, I have decided to start doing a podcast. It is called Transformative Principal. Each month, I will interview a principal that is making a real difference in students' lives. I hope that you enjoy it. First episode is embedded below. This is the RSS feed:&nbsp;<a href="http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/rss">http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/rss</a><br />
