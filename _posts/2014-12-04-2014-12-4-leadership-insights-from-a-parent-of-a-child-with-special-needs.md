>A number of high-profile business leaders have spoken publicly about their personal experiences with disabilities. Satya Nadella, the new Microsoft CEO, has two special-needs children (one is a quadriplegic). Virgin CEO Richard Branson has acknowledged having dyslexia. Carnival Australia CEO Ann Sherry says that her son with Down Syndrome “taught me that the world isn’t as neat as it seemed when I was growing up; that people have difficult lives thrust upon them.”
