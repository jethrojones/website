In my recent 
[podcast listener survey](https://goo.gl/forms/hyNn7tuEwdVVIn502), I had nearly all respondents ask how to make school change happen. They wanted to know the details around making our schools change.

So, I 
[created a podcast](http://transformativeprincipal.org/episode253) where I listed what we are doing at my school. This is now the third school where I have implemented big change and it is also the third way we have made that change happen.

In the first school it was all about data and students meeting targets.

In the second school it was much more about meeting standards.

In the third school, it is about personalizing learning.

What hasn't changed much is the four step process to make change happen.

*Vision


*Communication & Culture


*Empowerment of faculty, parents, and students


*Continuous improvement

When these four are in place, life is good. The change happens.

Take a listen to the 
[podcast here](http://transformativeprincipal.org/episode253).
