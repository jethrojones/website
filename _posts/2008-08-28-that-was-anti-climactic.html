Last week, I found out that <a href="http://www.howardstephenson.com/">Senator Howard Stephenson</a> would be coming to my classroom today. Each day, it seemed that the number of other visitors changed. I wasn't sure at all what would actually happen, and neither were the district people that were closer to the situation. Everything was shrouded in mystery.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgESIabhNF0w-TqL6udgXupZXt9pYUsrG2Sl_mwOT-r4Aa0gVYGddHXQhSbJ4zWRxIFKw435sMU8JHT4rTjb5PnEumw8LF-kfC7K2Q2PnbCNsNd6khmklklpmIZDXEknPfypp_jzYV8LxQg/s1600-h/IMG_5816.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgESIabhNF0w-TqL6udgXupZXt9pYUsrG2Sl_mwOT-r4Aa0gVYGddHXQhSbJ4zWRxIFKw435sMU8JHT4rTjb5PnEumw8LF-kfC7K2Q2PnbCNsNd6khmklklpmIZDXEknPfypp_jzYV8LxQg/s400/IMG_5816.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5239787069177204482" border="0" /></a><br />Yesterday, a rep from the audio enhancement company our school uses showed up to make sure that my microphone would feedback whenever I talked. I had turned down the high end because it was feedback city, and that took care of the problem. He came in (as a professional) and turned up the highs and seemed satisfied when it made the awful high-pitched scream. Silly man. I turned them back down in preparation for today's meeting.<br /><br />Senator Stephenson came into my room and observed with 5 or 6 other people. I was hoping that we could get my teacher evaluation out of they way today, but that was not meant to be. They sat there and watched me teach about online safety, and then left. They didn't ask me any questions, or interrupt my lesson, or anything. I wasn't expecting a highway being named after me, but I was expecting <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span>. There was nothing. I almost took a nap during my prep period immediately following the visit.<br /><br />The sad thing is that they missed the best part. The kids made a KWL chart about being safe online in Google Docs <a href="http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/Safe+Online">on the wiki</a>, and now we have a big list of everything that they know and want to know about being safe online. That part really was neat. It was hard to get my kids on task, because they were psyched out to be using the laptops.<br /><br />For a different view, you can read <a href="http://drapestakes.blogspot.com/2008/08/refreshing.html">Darren's</a> take on the whole thing (with a picture, even).
