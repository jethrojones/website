I got another job again. This one is better than delivering donuts (which I did last fall). I am the newest member of the gang at <a href="http://theappleblog.com/">The Apple Blog</a>. I will be writing articles that relate to Apple products. If you subscribe or visit this blog often, please consider visiting and/or subscribing to that blog. I will try to give an educational slant to most of my articles over there.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://theappleblog.com/"><img src="http://content.screencast.com/media/a7679864-f49c-4b72-b35c-ff3d0862ba76_6b5ba21b-5720-4de3-ae79-882494ea575c_static_0_0_00000108.png" border="0" height="63" width="334" /></a><br /></div><br />My first article over there is about <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/03/19/tubetv-a-handy-little-app-for-saving-your-videos/">TubeTV</a>--a program that downloads and converts online videos for iPod, iPhone, and AppleTV. I really like that program and I use it all the time. It is especially useful for teachers.<br /><br />Thanks for supporting me here (and there), and don't worry, I will continue this blog.
