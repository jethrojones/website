>I mean, you’d think that with all of the books on leadership and several years on the job, I would already know that two-way communication/feedback is vital to a smooth running, high performing school. Then again, if it were that easy there wouldn’t be so many books (and workshops, seminars, blog posts, webinars, mentoring sessions, and more devoted to the topic).



I imagine that Larry's staff gets to these two things because they trust he is willing to provide it. It takes time to build that trust and it is very important.
