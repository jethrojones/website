Last summer, I interviewed Sonny Magana about the T3 Instructional Framework.

It helps teachers use technology and has 3 levels:

*Transitional


*Transformational


*Transcendent

Traditionally, technology's impact in schools on achievement has been quite low.

That's crazy. In my own life, technology's impact on my achievement has been astronomical. In your life, it has likely been the same. Sonny seeks to teach educators how to ensure that technology has an impact.

Here's the teaser video from 
[Transformative Leadership Summit](https://gum.co/tls2018) with Sonny Magana this summer.

Using the T3 Framework, we can actually meet the real needs of the purpose of education. Sonny Magana for the 2018 Transformative Leadership Summit. Get your All Access Pass ticket at https://gum.co/tls2018
