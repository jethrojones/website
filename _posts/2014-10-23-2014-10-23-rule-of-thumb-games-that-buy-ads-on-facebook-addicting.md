>Maybe I need to cut back some of my hours on it,” Royals outfielder Lorenzo Cain told the newspaper with a laugh in July. “I think I’m going to cut back on it a little bit.”
  
  
After the team meeting and refocusing session, "the Royals won 16 of their next 19 games. The iPad usage became less conspicuous," the Star reported. But that didn't mean it was easy for every player.
  
  
“It’s ending,” outfielder Jarrod Dyson said of the game this summer. “I’m ending it. I’m winding it down. I’m toning it down. I’m trying to tone it down. It’s going to be hard, but I’m trying to tone it down.”



This is almost unbelievable. But at the same time, after seeing it myself, I know that video games can be addicting. I would just think that professional baseball players would have more self control. But we are all human!
