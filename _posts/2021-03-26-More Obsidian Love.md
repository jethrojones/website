As I'm playing with Obsidian more and more, I am just really loving it. It's got some features that are just dynamite.

Here are just two:

1\. When I paste in hyperlinks from a web site, they automatically convert the link to Markdown. It goes from [Hey World](http://world.hey.com/jethro) to \[Hey World\]([http://world.hey.com/jethro](http://world.hey.com/jethro)) when pasted. Each podcast guest I have creates a show notes page with their bio, links, etc. Every time they do, I have to convert that to Markdown. Now, I can just copy and paste. (Google Docs does some weird stuff to HTML, so you can't just view source and copy that, either.) 

2\. "Wikilinks" as I think they call them are not case sensitive, but if you change the title of the linked document, it updates the wikilink automatically. 

These two nice touches are just what the doctor ordered. 

I love using software that is a delight.
