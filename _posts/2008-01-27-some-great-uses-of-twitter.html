Somehow, I ended up at this <a href="http://www.jaredmadden.com/?p=17">post</a> by a guy named <a href="http://jaredmadden.com/">Jared Madden</a>. He talks about Presence Applications (PA) and how they are the new media and around to stay.<br /><blockquote>PA’s ‘bridge the gap’ between platforms and allow you to ’subscribe’ to a information source (be it a person or company).</blockquote><br />So, PAs like <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> allow you to use a cell phone, the web, a mini-app on your computer, or something else to subscribe to what (people) are presently doing. So, you can follow not just people, but also, oh, I don't know, what about <a href="http://twitter.com/lafd">fire departments</a>?<br /><a href="http://content.screencast.com/media/5fded35c-76ae-4779-92a0-b664df0a1b14_6b5ba21b-5720-4de3-ae79-882494ea575c_static_0_0_00000027.png"><img src="http://content.screencast.com/media/5fded35c-76ae-4779-92a0-b664df0a1b14_6b5ba21b-5720-4de3-ae79-882494ea575c_static_0_0_00000027.png" border="0" height="657" width="555" /></a><br /><br />This is amazing. I already follow a company, <a href="http://twitter.com/woot">Woot</a>.com, on Twitter so I can stay up to date with the great deals they offer. I follow a guy who is a tech job headhunter here in Utah, just in case ;). And I have my regular network of edutechers: educators that use technology and push for more technology integration in schools.<br /><br />Imagine in the emergency services world, you call 911, and they can autosubscribe you to a specific twitter feed regarding your call. You could get live updates of where the ambulance or fire engine or police officer is.<br /><br />Imagine a news outlet creating specific feeds for a particular developing story. I am sure this already exists to a certain extent, but I just don't know about it. Imagine notifying people of the election results in nearly real-time via Twitter.<br /><br />There is a group that does a <a href="http://twittories.wikispaces.com/">Twitter Story</a>, called <a href="http://www.twitter.com/twittories">twittories</a> where people contribute to stories in 140 character increments.<br /><br />Basically, the world is open for new ways of communicating. Although it can be scary to imagine that, it is also very exciting.<br /><br />Quick quote from @arthus on Twitter as I am writing this:<br /><blockquote>Actually, student implies there is a teacher and teacher implies that there is a student. Learner can be self-directed.</blockquote>
