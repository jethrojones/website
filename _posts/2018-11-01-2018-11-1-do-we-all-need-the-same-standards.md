I've been thinking a lot lately about standards. Do we all need the same standards?

Everyone needs to be able to read, because that is the gateway drug. Even with so much video accessible today, I still believe that everyone needs to be able to read.

Everyone needs some mathematical concepts, but how much?

Everyone needs to understand some parts of history, but there is so much more to it than just understanding dates and battles and people, but what exactly?

I'm going to make a bold claim (that isn't necessarily new) that our standards are too numerous. We 
need a lot fewer than we currently have. How much should they be stripped down? That's the real question.
