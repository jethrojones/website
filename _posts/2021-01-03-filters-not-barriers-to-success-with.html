He is a dynamic coach, teacher, leader, and speaker with a passion to encourage, empower, mentor, motivate, and educate young people. He believes in breaking down the barriers and excuses often used within his community towards the pursuit of education and higher learning. His philosophy is there is NO substitute for education and he strongly believes the cliché, “when you know better, you do better.” Finally, Anthony’s story is one of courage, determination, and perseverance as he is a 14 year conqueror of cancer. He has the courage to take a stand for what he believes in, the determination to make a difference, and the perseverance to see it through no matter the obstacle.</p> <p>Professor at Ultimate Medical Academy and Hillsborough Community College.</p> <ul> <li>Diversity Panel recordings:</li> <li><a href= "https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/WKhvC6qDzFh1xyqSJljhQxIrjeYsWUk3QnPu6XR-oxaQ6Uq0E2FB1pjHWjFP8JTv.oo4UiW3wtJ6lZwlR?startTime=1599764156000"> Panel 1 - Diversity: Essential Truths</a></li> <li><a href= "https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/UZHYhPycQrZYwNe1aJjcztuMZ116R5tmuvu6rL_mm95k9jnxTvtN5a5u1NPOqRXn.Fv8Kw9zHaP5sjc8X"> Panel 2 - Diversity: Getting Personal</a></li> <li><a href= "https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/5AnVA2oJ8eiORTUQQQOZhaJpwO1CpT_HeIlfnRz6cXjHKg6T5OJSBvGtT2U7p4b3.yHxwrsQNRqmRTbWJ?startTime=1600972634000"> Panel 3 - Diversity: The Bigger Picture</a></li> <li>Within the black community there is a stigma to education.</li> <li>There is a mindset that our interest goes off into other areas.</li> <li>Education is the equalizer.</li> <li>The pursuit of knowledge is really education.</li> <li>A goal of mine is to use the triangle offense mindset</li> <li>How to support those who think they can’t get out of their current situation because they are</li> <li>There’s only one race in this world, that’s the human race.</li> <li>Why is there a box?
