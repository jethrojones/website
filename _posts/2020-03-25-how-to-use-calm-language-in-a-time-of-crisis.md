I’ll never forget the day that an Army Major yelled and berated me for an hour.

It was not a fun experience, to say the least.

This man’s son had gotten into trouble by fighting in the hallway, and his spot on the team was in jeopardy.

Afterward, I talked to the secretary about it, and told her that if he shows up again, we needed to call the police.

She was shocked. She said, “I peeked in on you a couple times and you looked calm as a summer’s day!”

In times of crisis, it is important to maintain our composure and not lose sight of what’s important.

I 
was mad at the Major in that siutation, but, I knew that my demeanor could control the situation and either help it calm down or pour gasoline on it!

Coming up next week, I’ll be doing a 
[webinar with Love in a Big World](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/439457779) about keeping calm during the crises that we face regularly, but especially this crisis we are facing now.

We’ll talk about:

*Phrases to show empathy


*Phrases to give yourself some time to think!


*Phrases to calm fears


*How to control your voice.


*Phone vs. in person vs. video conversations.

Also, next week, I am doing a Principal Innovation Workshop with EdElements around 
[innovating within the constraints of the distance learning](https://www.edelements.com/virtual-principal-innovation-session-april-1-2020?hsCtaTracking=f77b297e-9663-4895-9c1d-be623205f726%7Ceafa8d49-9166-48fe-b1d6-8026c9b40e4d) newness that so many of us are under right now.

In this workshop, you will 
walk away with a 1-page plan for narrowing down your focus to the specific things that you actually need to do for the rest of this virtual learning year (or less if you’re in that boat).

Come ready to get work done and turn out an awesome product.

These are uncertain times and I’m hopeful that the things I’m working on will be some small amount of support.

If you can’t make these webinars, replays will be available, so go ahead and register.
