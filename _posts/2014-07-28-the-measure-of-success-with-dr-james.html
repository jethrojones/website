I think he is just what the district needs and I am really excited for what he will bring to the table. We talked about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where Dr. Briscoe got his start in education and in administration</li>
<li>His diverse experience as a leader of schools that were from incredibly high-achieving to greatly struggling.</li>
<li>Engaging in the community by being involved in community issues (building new police station, hospital, etc.)</li>
<li>The political struggles that lead Dr. Briscoe to retirement from his school district.</li>
<li>Why he felt like Canyons School District was a good match for him.</li>
<li>Why it is so important to be out and about and seen.</li>
<li>How to build trust. Time.</li>
<li>What happened in the past, is in the past. Let&rsquo;s not worry about it.</li>
<li>The culture he wants to create: Trust &amp; Collaboration.</li>
<li>Honoring the past.</li>
<li>How he measures the success of his superintendency, not to be confused with his job description.</li>
<li>Why that measure of success is so important.</li>
</ul>
