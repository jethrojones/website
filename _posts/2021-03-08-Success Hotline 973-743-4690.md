I learned about Dr. Rob Gilbert's Success Hotline today. 

Did you know about it? Call this number: 973-743-4690

Today he shares a great story about a woman named Wilma who overcame being confined to a wheelchair to be an olympic athlete. Powerful. 

But that part isn't even that powerful. 

What was so amazing is that this was message #10,975!

Yesterday I was pretty proud of approaching 400 episodes of my podcast. Today, I'm humbled that Dr. Gilbert has done nearly 11,000 of these! That's 30 years!!!

It's good to be humbled.
