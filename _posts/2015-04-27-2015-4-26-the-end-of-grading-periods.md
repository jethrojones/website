Mike Kelly:


>In many schools, including the one in which I work, teachers have adopted great practices such as ongoing formative assessment, re-teaching, re-testing and allowing students to re-do assignments. However, even with the implementation of these successful grading and instructional practices, the old "learning clock" still counts down to the end of the marking period. It's like trying to beat the sand timer in a board game. All learning must be complete before all the sand gets to the bottom on the hour glass, or it's too late. So, why?



I sure love the idea of not having marking periods. I'm excited to see where this goes.
