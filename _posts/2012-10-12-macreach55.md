Last night, I was fortunate enough to be on the 
[MacReach](http://edreach.us/macreachshow/) podcast with 
[@kdumont](https://twitter.com/kdumont) and 
[http://twitter.com/ipodsibilities](http://twitter.com/ipodsibilities). It was a lot of fun. They have a great show, and I hope I didn't bring the quality down too much.


We talked a bit about workflows and Paperless Principal. I always learn a lot from that podcast, so it was an honor to play a small part in creating it.


As I announced on the podcast, I am giving away a copy of my book and a copy of the app JotNot Scanner Pro. Just like 
[Paperless Principal on Facebook](http://facebook.com/PaperlessPrincipal) or tweet using the hashtag 
[#paperlessprincipal](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23paperlessprincipal)
