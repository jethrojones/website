A couple months ago, I commented on how great it is when <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-02-07-learning-is-supposed-to-be-frustrating %}">learning is frustrating</a>. Well, it is still great, but sometimes it is not that great. As you may have noticed, I took off all the posts from my internship this summer. My principal made a good point, she said that I was privy to a lot of information and that I didn't realize how much trust I was given.<br /><br />I know that I make mistakes and that I am not perfect, but I sure don't like being told about it.<br /><br />The feelings that I experienced when she told me were very conflicted. I was sad, hurt, offended, suddenly aware of the weight of that job, and extremely grateful that she told me how she felt. It is not fun to be called out, but it is sometimes needed.<br /><br />Thank you Mrs. P. for a wonderful internship, and helping me learn something that was hard to swallow, but needed to be said.<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
