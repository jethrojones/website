Passionate about risk management, cyber security, behavior design, and education; Snapshots of her contributions can be found on IBMTV ‘World Edition’; Cyber Talk with Rex Lee and Merle Garrison; KUTV Channel 4 (Utah), KSL News Radio, and more.</p> <p>Please add questions that we would ask here, and you can add anything that you would like to add as well.</p> <p>Positioning: school IT systems collect and manage sensitive data about students, about their parents, guardians, and families, about educators and other school staff, and about school district operations. In some cases, these IT systems are locally hosted on school district premises or in shared hosting arrangements with other local government entities; increasingly, they are hosted by an ecosystem of vendors ‘in the cloud’ on systems accessible by any internet-connected device. While there are myriad benefits to the adoption and use of IT systems by school districts—and to the collection and sharing of education-related data with trusted partners—it is important we acknowledge that any adoption of technology also introduces cybersecurity risk.</p> <ul> <li>145 data breach incidents involving public schools (representing 36 percent of all incidents disclosed during 2020).</li> <li>Why have cyber threats to schools escalated?</li> <li>What types of information/data are cyber criminals after?</li> <li>Not making learning punitive</li> <li>Within the context of the school, does gamification raise the potential for cyberbullying?</li> <li>Don’t want learning to be punitive.</li> <li>If I felt judged or looked at, things were harder.</li> <li>How microlearning helps us learn.</li> <li>Varying the way it is delivered.</li> <li>Awake, bathroom, coffee, dog,</li> <li>attention span is decreasing.</li> <li>Brain starts forgetting critical things because of what we are stuffing in it.</li> <li><a href= "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headway-self-growth-challenge/id1457185832"> App headway</a></li> <li>With all the information out there in this digital age, there seems to be many training opportunities that come along with it; What are the challenges?</li> <li>“You will lose it if you don’t use it.” But since&nbsp; our brains can only hold a limited amount of&nbsp; information (1,000 - 2.5 million gigabytes),&nbsp; how do we keep every bit of information that&nbsp; we want to remember?</li> <li>How many different learning types have been identified?</li> <li>How can we meet the training needs of these students?</li> <li>As cybersecurity isn’t the most exciting topic; How can we make learning more fun and interesting?</li> <li>There’s a lot of buzz around microlearning in education.
