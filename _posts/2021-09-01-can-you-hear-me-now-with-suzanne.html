Research into her own son’s learning difficulties led her to author the Classroom Auditory Learning Issues Resolution, adopted by the National PTA in July 2007. Her work has appeared in Our Children Magazine, THE Journal, Towson Times, and The Baltimore Sun.</p> <p>She has presented at the National School Boards Association’s annual convention; to nation, state, and local PTA groups; and to politicians. Suzanne was awarded the National PTA Life Achievement Award in May 2007, the highest honor from the nation’s largest child advocacy organization.</p> <p>She is also the Author of "Can you hear me now? Join the Conversation to Make Public Education a Better Choice"</p> <ul> <li>Three children, middle child had auditory processing deficits. Ears could capture auditory signals perfectly but brain couldn't process it correctly.</li> <li>Many children struggle with hearing issues.</li> <li>If you say, "I have a teacher voice, I don't need a microphone!" I will shame you.</li> <li>Parent supported holding their student behind and being told no.</li> <li>Don't tell kids all day they are dumb and then keep them in an afterschool program to tell them their dumb again!</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal? Give the book to each teacher - We can start with the problems in your classroom.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>What motivated you to write a book about the public education system?</li> <li>What are some of the problems that you have experienced which you hope to shed some light on?</li> <li>How is your book different from other books in education?</li> <li>How can your experience advocating for teacher microphones in classrooms help other parents and teachers to improve the public education system?</li> <li>What did you like most about teaching?</li> <li>What do you hope your readers will learn from reading this book?</li> </ul> <h2>Sponsors</h2> <h3>InControl SEL for Middle School</h3> <p>In Control created an effortless social and emotional, character development video curriculum for your students that’s ZERO-TEACHER-PREP AND it’s so cool looking- it feels like a Youtube or Netflix Series- and that’s purposeful, they meet students right where they’re at.</p> <p>The videos are 5-6 minutes, kids love them, teachers love them, and you will too. There’s no guesswork in the program because there’s a 21-video progression for each grade level.</p> <p>They’ve thought of everything-- because it’s a group of award winning counselors, teachers, and principals that came up with this thing. It’ll help you save tons of time and headaches.</p> <p>Take it from me, it’s time to check that social-emotional learning box, the empty one that’s been keeping you up at night--and it’s time to do it in a meaningful, measurable, magnetic way.</p> <p>If you go to <a href= "https://www.incontrolsel.com/jethro">www.InControlSEL.com/jethro</a> you can check out some of the videos and even receive 20% off if you pre-order for next school year</p> <h3><a href="https://us.johncattbookshop.com">John Catt</a></h3> <p>Today’s Transformative Principal sponsor, John Catt Educational, amplifies world-class voices on timeless topics, with a list of authors recognized globally for their fresh perspectives and proven strategies to drive success in modern schools and classrooms.</p> <p>John Catt’s mission is to support high-quality teaching and learning by ensuring every educator has access to professional development materials that are research-based, practical, and focused on the key topics proven essential in today’s and tomorrow’s schools.</p> <p>Learn more about professional development publications that are easy to implement for your entire faculty, and are both quickly digestible and rigorous, by visiting <a class="url" href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://us.johncattbookshop.com/</a>.
