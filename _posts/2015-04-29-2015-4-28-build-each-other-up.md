>To that end I offer this simple bit of advice -Actions speak louder than words and in the long run are more respected. Instead of putting other people down let your work do the talking.  There is no greater influential force than that of modeling.  As they say, talk is cheap.  There is nothing cheaper than taking shots from behind a computer screen at other educators whose success has come as a result of hard work.



Maybe I am ignorant, but thankfully, I don't see this negative stuff happening. It saddens me that it does happen. We are better than that.
