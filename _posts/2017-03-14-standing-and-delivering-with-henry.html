Henry served as the Principal of Garfield High School during the period depicted in the film “Stand and Deliver” about Jamie Escalante’s success’ and challenges. Henry is a well known Educator and Motivational Speaker.</p> <p>In this book, Dr. Gradillas shares both his upbeat philosophy of education and the practical school management techniques that helped translate that philosophy&nbsp;into success for thousands of students over three decades. The books focuses on three areas that are key to the operation of an effective school: School Climate, instruction, and curriculum. It includes many references to the Garfield High School experience, as well as to other schools where Dr. Gradillas was principal.</p> <ul> <li>How to adjust</li> <li><a href= "http://www.thebestschools.org/special/escalante-gradillas-prize/">Thebestschools.org</a> prize</li> <li>Kids are so involved on other things.</li> <li>Teaching Spanish at 83!</li> <li>Using today’s technology</li> <li>How do you support great teachers, without other teachers wanting to cut their heads off?</li> <li>They told me it couldn’t be done.</li> <li>Why AP is so important?</li> <li>Why is it so difficult to implement dual credit for high schools and colleges still?</li> <li>Did not change one thing in the district policy, but interpreted to make it work.</li> <li>Stamp of Approval for “Gifted” students.</li> <li>How can we implement this in lower grades?</li> <li>Infusing Math through everything</li> <li>Teach it to students early enough that they would be interested in it!</li> <li>How to deal with the difficult things as they happen:</li> <li>Because you know you’re right!</li> <li>I am so glad that finally the principal is doing what principals should do!</li> <li>Give the kids the opportunity to say how their school is helping them.</li> <li>Mandated Algebra for every high school student.</li> <li>When you don’t give a class to a student because you don’t offer it, you start them out as adults in a negative.</li> <li>When you’re in command, Command! Or get out!</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal? Go into a faculty and staff meeting and say: We are working hard, and we have some problems. Give me one thing that I can do to help you and make your teaching more effective? Secondly, give me one thing that I can do in the long-term to help you be more effective? Third, give me something that will improve what your doing for next year? Then what can you do yourself to move this along.</li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz_zKCgCLnQ">How Jethro increased attendance</a></li> </ul> <p>Are you feeling like you are always behind at school?
