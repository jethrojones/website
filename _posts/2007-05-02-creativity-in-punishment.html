I really like thinking up ways to creatively punish students. This student continued to text on his phone during class, even after I asked him to stop. In reality, he wanted his hair cut anyway, and I suggested that we do this to teach the other students a lesson...but don't tell anyone.<br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vh4XFa4yCUs"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vh4XFa4yCUs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></embed></object>
