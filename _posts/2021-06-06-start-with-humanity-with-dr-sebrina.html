Lindsay-Law</a> serves as the Coordinator for Equity and Opportunity in the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for Virginia Beach City Public Schools.&nbsp; Prior to serving in this role, Dr. Lindsay-Law worked as a school improvement specialist, secondary social studies teacher, and middle school dean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Law attended Old Dominion University where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree in secondary social studies education.&nbsp; Then she earned a master of art degree in administration and supervision from The George Washington University.&nbsp; In August 2019 she completed her doctorate degree in educational leadership and policy studies from The George Washington University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>She believes through inclusive conversations, empathetic listening opportunities, and adaptive practices teams can establish solution oriented outcomes to support communities and organizations.&nbsp; Furthermore, when teams and organizations utilize strengths to guide conversations, practices, and systems then teams can have sustainable networks.&nbsp; Sustainable networks can build collective efficacy for communities and edify personal efficacy for all individuals.&nbsp; She states, “there is so much work to be done.&nbsp; Let’s work together to enhance our society.”&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Start with humanity</li> <li>Being comfortable with discomfort.</li> <li>Be more receptive to non-closure.</li> <li>Look ago ourselves</li> <li>What mark and good do I want to leave on this community.</li> <li>We have different types of biases that come up, sometimes unconscious.</li> <li>How to be a friend and ally.</li> <li>You have to be your own personality.</li> <li>What can I do to make an environment inclusive?</li> <li>Be personable according to your style.</li> <li>Consider yourself.</li> <li>Degrees of intensity.</li> <li>Always looking for inclusion.</li> <li>Individual self within that.</li> <li>Collective efficacy</li> <li>DEI work is participatory and requires full engagement.</li> <li>Community partnerships with curating history on kids who integrated the schools.</li> <li>Norfolk 17 (Sebrina’s Aunt)</li> <li>Artwork reflecting their own history.</li> <li>Unity, Leadership, Action</li> <li>Cocreating and participating.</li> <li>Desegregation and integration are two separate things.</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal?

There’s no guesswork in the program because there’s a 21-video progression for each grade level.</p> <p>They’ve thought of everything-- because it’s a group of award winning counselors, teachers, and principals that came up with this thing. It’ll help you save tons of time and headaches.</p> <p>Take it from me, it’s time to check that social-emotional learning box, the empty one that’s been keeping you up at night--and it’s time to do it in a meaningful, measurable, magnetic way.</p> <p>If you go to <a href= "https://www.incontrolsel.com/jethro">www.InControlSEL.com/jethro</a> you can check out some of the videos and even receive 20% off if you pre-order for next school year</p> <h3><a href="https://us.johncattbookshop.com">John Catt</a></h3> <p>Today’s Transformative Principal sponsor, John Catt Educational, amplifies world-class voices on timeless topics, with a list of authors recognized globally for their fresh perspectives and proven strategies to drive success in modern schools and classrooms.</p> <p>John Catt’s mission is to support high-quality teaching and learning by ensuring every educator has access to professional development materials that are research-based, practical, and focused on the key topics proven essential in today’s and tomorrow’s schools.</p> <p>Learn more about professional development publications that are easy to implement for your entire faculty, and are both quickly digestible and rigorous, by visiting https://us.johncattbookshop.com/.
