I grew up playing a multitude of sports and got into coaching alongside my sister who is also a teacher.&nbsp; For a few summers during college, I was splitting my day interning at my dad’s company and coaching swimming.&nbsp; Each day, I would dread going to the office and count the hours until I could be with young people coaching swimming.&nbsp; That final summer proved pivotal and I came to the realization that pursuing business or an office type job was just not for me.</p> <p>Thankfully, Teach For America existed to allow me to jump into teaching and utilize my bilingualism in Spanish.&nbsp; I knew that in order to truly give education a shot, I needed to leave my friends and family in Chicago, so I moved to Denver to teach 5th grade in a bilingual classroom.&nbsp; Unlike most of my friends at the time, I ended up staying in Denver for 5 years teaching in the same school.&nbsp; During my final 2 years, I also took on full-time teacher residents and realized I had a passion for developing educators.</p> <p>At the same time, I had maintained a dream of living abroad and decided that after 5 years, the time was right to make that happen.&nbsp; My then fiance who is a high school counselor then applied to schools all of Latin America.&nbsp; We ended up landing jobs at the American School of Guatemala in Guatemala City.&nbsp; For us, these were two of the best years of our lives for a number of reasons.&nbsp; For me, I had begun to feel burned out on the constant pressure to show student achievement on a standardized test.</p> <p>Working in Guatemala, we had no standardized test and I was able to grow my practice tremendously as an educator.&nbsp; At the same time, a new school leader came in with me my first year.&nbsp; It was through him that I got to witness and feel the power of an excellent leader for the first time.&nbsp; He not only changed the culture of the school, but also the trajectory of the school.&nbsp; This was the first time I really considered school leadership as a realistic pathway.</p> <p>During our second year, I began to feel the pull to begin working with students where I really felt needed compared to the incredibly wealthy families we served in Guatemala.&nbsp; I was aware of the School Leadership Program through the University of Denver and decided that it was time to see if I might be able to follow his lead, but serving a population I really cared for.</p> <p>After being accepted to the program, my bilingualism proved pivotal again and I landed an internship at Academia Ana Marie Sandoval, a dual language public Montessori School in Denver.&nbsp; My first year at the school was eye opening to say the least.&nbsp; I had been used to being an effective teacher and immediately felt uncomfortable and very ineffective.&nbsp; I learned quickly that my strength was not direct and honest communication.&nbsp; I caused many tears and considered returning to the classroom midway through the year.&nbsp; Thankfully, I had a great mentor and the support of a peer group in my program and confronted many of the issues within my control.</p> <p>As the next two years progressed, I became a far better communicator and really learned to sit beside teachers, families and students.&nbsp; At the same time, I was being pushed towards principalship a few different schools.&nbsp; After verbally accepting an offer, I realized that I was not trusting my intuition and was making decisions on a faulty premise.</p> <p>Reneging in this way forced me to reconsider my complete path professionally.&nbsp; As a new dad, I was concerned about my ability to be present for my daughter and wife with the rigors and stress of principalship.&nbsp; I actually began applying to positions in the corporate world thinking that I might have both more financial stability and less work to bring home.</p> <p>Around that same time, my nephew invited me on a ski trip with his school.&nbsp; I had actually been the one to find his school a year earlier and reluctantly joined him on the trip.&nbsp; His school was a micro-school in North Denver called Embark, and he was thriving there.&nbsp; I rode up to the mountain with Miguel, the school director, and we chatted as collegial administrators do.&nbsp; He mentioned that Embark would be opening a 6th grade to go along with the existing 7th/8th grade in order to capitalize on enrollment.</p> <p>I didn’t think too much more about it, but I really loved what I saw on that trip from the educators and the students and went home that night feeling jealous of the school.&nbsp; It hit me almost immediately that I would be the next 6th grade educator at Embark.&nbsp; After reaching out to Miguel, interviewing, and discussing with my wife, I made the very unobvious, to some, decision to go back to the classroom.</p> <p>This would potentially be looked at as a downward move, but the truth was exactly the opposite.&nbsp; In this position I would be given nearly full autonomy to create my own school.&nbsp; I had the resources, support, and tools from my experiences and viewed this as my Thesis.</p> <p>Even with COVID, this year has been fantastic.&nbsp; With my 6th graders, we have pushed the envelope of what is possible in school with the long-term ambition of being trim-tabs in education.&nbsp; In my work with Miguel and anyone else in the organization, I have felt the synchronicity and empowerment to be bold.&nbsp; I have also built and experienced something real and powerful and found a third way.</p> <p>Many lessons have been learned along the way for me, but the power of horizontal leadership and rapid thoughtful iteration are two that are currently top of mind for me.</p> <ul> <li>How can we reenvision what education could look like?</li> <li>Lemon Lavendar Latte - Top selling spring seasonal beverage at Pinwheel Coffee.</li> <li>Kids got into test kitchen and brainstormed ideas.</li> <li>10 different iterations before pitching to pros.</li> <li>Working as part of the coffee shop.</li> <li>See what would happen if they tried ratios that just made sense.</li> <li>It’s ok to see education as a game</li> <li>The kids who didn’t win won more.</li> <li>Quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, and collaboration</li> <li>Collaboration is not a buzz word.
