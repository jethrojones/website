>How is it that some students have so much to say when talking out loud, but when a pencil is put into their hand they suddenly hesitate, struggle and have nothing to say? How can you help those hesitant writers eliminate the "handicap" or barrier that suddenly appears when asked to write?



So, I suppose that going from not writing at all to writing is an improvement, but this article isn't really about improving writing, as it is about getting kids to get their thoughts out in some way. Perhaps this will be enough to get those students who are happy to talk but struggling to write to be able to see that they can produce something, and then start writing.
