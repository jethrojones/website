So many teachers have golden handcuffs keeping them tied to jobs that just make them miserable. My podcast is focused on educators hoping to change their station so they can teach where they want, and how they want. </p><p>Too long we educators have abdicated responsibility for our money to someone else. Let’s take control and listen to my story, which I will share in WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL so you know exactly what <a href="https://jethrojones.gumroad.com/l/pifor200">you can do to start with just $200</a>. Seriously. That’s what I started with in April of this year. You can do it, too. </p><p>The podcast will detail my journey, and I’ll interview some awesome people to learn about what others are doing also. </p><p>Coming up in Season 1: </p><ul><li><p>How I made 48% return in the stock market this year!</p></li><li><p>How a high school history teacher is now worth tens of millions of dollars.</p></li><li><p>How a superintendent was able to leave a district and have a small part time superintendent job and golf every day</p></li><li><p>A coaching session where a teacher decides it is time to leave her teaching job. </p></li><li><p>Detailed monthly reports of my passive income. </p></li><li><p>And much more to come….</p></li></ul><p>Keep an eye on your inbox, as I’ll be sending you notices when the podcast is updated and subscribers get the detailed monthly reports. </p><p></p>
