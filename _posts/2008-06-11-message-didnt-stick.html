I am participating in a program by our school district called the Engaged Classroom. I (and two other teachers) are going to have a mobile lab with a bunch of other technology to use for the year, and hopefully create some good projects and learning opportunities for our students. This is exactly the type of thing that I have wanted to do for a long time, so I am glad that I now have the opportunity.<br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/kdumont">Kelly</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ddraper">Darren</a> are doing a great job teaching a very technologically diverse group of people about the different tools we should/will be using. They are experiencing what any other person teaching about technology will experience: sometimes, people just don't get it. Even if they say, "Yes, teacher, I understand what you are asking and I will do it from now on just like that."<br /><br />After learning how to use Diigo (which I finally kind of understand now, thanks), Wikis, Google Docs, and plenty of other collaborative web apps, one student wanted to share a link with another student. So, this is what she did:)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWrD2Kf4N4YNY7XZ3po74KRtLd51iB-jNIO9JgpSj5qtIf9vp6CTXXpPe4_2WYWhPIG3Z1PQBectGtnzwaagJx5TILBX067Qbb739TF068ObCBA8DjAFKaY19czRM7eTTLl3donNlyQlXM/s1600-h/Photo+7.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWrD2Kf4N4YNY7XZ3po74KRtLd51iB-jNIO9JgpSj5qtIf9vp6CTXXpPe4_2WYWhPIG3Z1PQBectGtnzwaagJx5TILBX067Qbb739TF068ObCBA8DjAFKaY19czRM7eTTLl3donNlyQlXM/s400/Photo+7.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210685772076725458" border="0" /></a><br /><br />You gotta love that. The image is backwards, and it is because I took it from Photo Booth and didn't have the energy to mirror the image so it came out right. Call me lazy. <br /><br />Honestly, the worst thing in the world to me (not really, but a close second to getting stung by a jellyfish) is writing out <span style="font-weight:bold;">by hand</span> URLs. Talk about torture!<br /><br />So the real question is, what is this person going to do with what she has "learned" this week? I am most certainly not mocking or poking holes in the wonderfully developed program. They have done a lot to make sure that they are following up; we must make a portfolio, attend monthly meetings, and teach others about the same things we are learning. This is a large beast to tackle for them, and I am excited to be a part of it. <br /><br /><br />Have a Good Life.
