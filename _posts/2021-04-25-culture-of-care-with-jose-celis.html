He believes that schools should promote wholeness, equity, and hope. In various administrative capacities, he has devoted his energies to ensuring students, families, and educators develop strong partnerships, grounded in mutual support and respect. Having served in diverse communities in both New Jersey and Illinois, he has recognized the need to support teachers in areas where they may not have received adequate training. His passion areas include restorative justice for education, culturally responsive teaching, sheltered-instruction, and inclusion for equity</p> <ul> <li>Remember my goal and vision and reflect all my decisions on that.</li> <li>Jose talks about moving from assimilation to becoming a community with diverse individuals.</li> <li>Three concentric circles - community -</li> <li>Inclusion & Restorative Justice, and why he is in education (his back story)</li> </ul> <h2>Sponsors</h2> <h3>InControl SEL for Middle School</h3> <p>In Control created an effortless social and emotional, character development video curriculum for your students that’s ZERO-TEACHER-PREP AND it’s so cool looking- it feels like a Youtube or Netflix Series- and that’s purposeful, they meet students right where they’re at.</p> <p>The videos are 5-6 minutes, kids love them, teachers love them, and you will too.
