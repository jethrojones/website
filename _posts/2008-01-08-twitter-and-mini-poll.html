Let's get right down to it. I would like to request some comments for my Political Aspects of Education class that I am taking right now. First question is:<br /><br />What are the major challenges facing American public education right now?<br /><br />The second questions is for Utahns and other informed parties that know what happened here last year with school choice and school vouchers.<br /><br />After the voucher vote this last year, do you intend to vote for different legislature members this year?<br /><br />Please respond to these two questions in the comments. You can post anonymously, if you feel so inclined.<br /><br />Now on to the good stuff. I have been using <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> since the middle of December. To be honest, I don't know how I got started on it. I think that it might have been from my friend, Chris, but I could be wrong. Anyway, it was about the same time that I started using <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>. Facebook mostly helped me get better at Scrabble (and connect with some old friends, I guess). The best thing about Twitter is that I have been using it a lot to help me get ideas for teaching. I mostly just read what other people mention, and I have met some really neat people and learned so much I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />I am collaborating with another middle school teacher in Kansas on a <a href="http://campaigntrailcollaboration.wikispaces.com/super%20tuesday%21">wiki for the presidential primaries</a>. I also got connected with some other edutech bloggers here in Utah, in my district even, and that is really neat also. I have felt so alone recently because I don't feel like anyone in my district, even the tech guy at my school, is very social web literate or even interested in it. I just recently learned that one other person at my school does have a blog, but it is private and I have not received an invitation. I also have found other middle school teachers on twitter and that helps also because I can bounce ideas off of them as well as get brand new ideas from them.<br /><br />I am so impressed with how kind the community has been in helping me out and using it as a tool to help others. I enjoy knowing that many of my questions are answered without too much waiting.
