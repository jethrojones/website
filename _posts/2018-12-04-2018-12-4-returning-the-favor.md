[Returning the Favor](https://www.facebook.com/ReturningTheFavor/videos/pens-and-pencils-all-in-a-rowe/1964830810454846/) is a show with Mike Rowe about giving back to people who do awesome things. The episode linked above is about a former teacher who collects schools supplies because schools are underfunded.

This is a feel-good show about good people doing good things. I love this kind of stuff. Remember Extreme Home Makeover? Lots of "I'm not crying, you're crying" going on there.

The only problem is it looks like the show is only available on Facebook, which is not where I want to watch long-form video.

Thanks Ben Gilpin for sharing it.
