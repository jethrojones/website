>Differentiation isn't making things easier or letting students off the hook rather it is insuring all the students have the same chance to succeed. In a strange way but making things FAIR  while at the time may not always be equal but by doing so we are giving all of our students an EQUAL chance to succeed.



Fair is not equal. We talk a lot about equity in education. We want everyone to be successful. We want to provide supports to those who don't have them to make it so they can be successful.
