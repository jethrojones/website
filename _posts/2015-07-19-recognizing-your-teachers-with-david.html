Started the company from<br /> Author of <a href="http://amzn.to/1LFK8eq">Built to Lead: 7 Management R.E.W.A.R.D.S Principles for Becoming a Top 10% Manager.</a>. This book is amazing, and I learned a ton from talking to David. He is a businessman, and not an educator, but he is really on point here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Top 1% in all three industries he has participated in, so topics relatable to all industries.</li>
<li>Employee recognition programs.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not just plaques for employee recognition.</li>
<li>It is normal to procrastinate, forget, or otherwise delay awards and recognition for employees.</li>
<li>Great intentions last only 3 months.</li>
<li>Recognize 2 people from each department.</li>
<li>20% or higher growth per year because of this employee recognition.</li>
<li>Employee recognition is the greatest way to get people to buy into your vision for the school.</li>
<li>Teachers will only be successful if the kids are successful, so we need to make our teachers and kids successful.</li>
<li>Metrics for schools: Don&rsquo;t want it to be a popularity contest!</li>
<li>Measure what you are already using.</li>
<li>Recognition has to be administered every 7&ndash;10 days.</li>
<li><a href="http://transformativeprincipal.org/tpdownloads/EmployeeRecognitionReminderChart_OfflineVersion.xlsx">Employee recognition reminder chart.</a> - <a href="http://transformativeprincipal.org/tpdownloads/EmployeeRecognitionReminderChart_OnlineVersion.xlsx">Digital Version</a> Recognize everyone 3 times a month!</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t find something to recognize them for, you&rsquo;re dropping the ball as a leader.</li>
<li>We do not outgrow the desire to be shown that we are significant.</li>
<li>If teachers don&rsquo;t feel like they are part of the team, they want to leave you.</li>
<li>Two reasons people want to leave your school: 1) Not getting recognition or 2) the leader is forcing them to work with incompetent people.</li>
<li>You have to show the teachers that they matter.</li>
<li>People will listen to you because you care.</li>
<li>You will lose good people sometimes if you focus on them</li>
<li>Many employees receive no recognition for months at a time.</li>
<li>Find as many metrics as you can.</li>
<li>Demotivator: not using metrics to determine employee recognition, i.e., If someone comes in late and leaves early every day, and you reward that person.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make recognition about &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this person&rsquo;s turn.&rdquo;</li>
<li>80/20 rule. Recognize top 20% of each department.<br /> Part 2</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Student engagement surveys for teachers. Simplistic questions: How well do you feel the teacher teaches&hellip;? How well do you feel your teacher encourages you&hellip;? (What would be good)</li>
<li>Interview and assess what the kids are getting from their teachers.</li>
<li>Metrics he uses: Dollar/ticket, renewal sales, how many calls they answer, answering the phones by the third ring,</li>
<li>Kaizan - continuous improvement, monitoring something causes the production of it to increase by 10 percent.</li>
<li><a href="http://jethrojones.com/tedxcsdteachers">TEDxCSDTeachers</a> - increase attendance by 10%.</li>
<li>shoutoutcards.com - stubs or something to remind you of what someone did well.</li>
<li>Let your people shine.</li>
<li>Book clubs - teach your teachers how to improve their lives - personal development, not books related to our profession.</li>
<li>Dr. Tony Zeiss - <a href="http://amzn.to/1NzcTI6">12 Essential Rules for Becoming Indispensable</a></li>
<li>Book clubs help teams that don&rsquo;t usually work together work together.</li>
<li>Side note: teach kids how to use money and have their money spent effectively.</li>
<li>What can principals do? Use the recognition chart to make sure you are checking in on your teachers.</li>
<li>Invest in your own education, learn how to be a better principal, teacher, speaker, etc.</li>
