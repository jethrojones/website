I heard this today in church from 
[Elder J. Devn Cornish](https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/2016/10/am-i-good-enough-will-i-make-it?l=eng):

>“Please, my beloved brothers and sisters, we must stop comparing ourselves to others. We torture ourselves needlessly by competing and comparing. We falsely judge our self-worth by the things we do or don’t have and by the opinions of others. If we must compare, let us compare how we were in the past to how we are today--and even to how we want to be in the future. The only opinion of us that matters is what our Heavenly Father thinks of us.”


I’m going to continue talking and emailing about goal setting, and if you set goals and desires so that you can compare to others, you will always feel inadequate.

I can’t tell you enough how powerful it has been for me to learn, slowly, so slowly, this skill. I still have a long way to go, but my millimeters of growth in the last couple years has taken kilograms off my shoulders.

A few years from now, I know I will be even further along, and can’t wait for that.
