I was talking to a student today about what kinds of things she thought needed to happen in her school with the new year coming up.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>She said something so insightful, that I could not believe that it was a 7th grader saying it to a bunch of adults. She elaborated on a concept that many teachers do not yet grasp. The clarity and simplicity with which she came to her conclusions was astounding.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>She said (a little paraphrasing from my memory), "We need to do something about the discipline at our school. When I see what these kids who have to go into ISS (in-school suspension) becomeâ€¦well I dot like the kind of people they are becoming. Going to ISS doesn't help them do anything different and that makes me sad."</div><div><br></div><div>I asked her what she thought should happen and she said, "I don't know what the best thing to do is, but I know ISS is not working for the kids at my school, because it doesn't make them change anything."&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We were then able to have a discussion about what we, as adults, can do to help kids who make mistakes learn how to make better decisions. This girl was a little sheepish to say these things to a bunch of educated adults, but she was right on the money in her assessment of the situation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I admire this girl for saying what she believed. I admire her for being perceptive and aware of the situation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Have a Good Life.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
