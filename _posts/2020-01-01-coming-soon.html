<p><strong>This is Deep Thoughts</strong>, a newsletter about Deep thoughts on education, leadership, and faith.</p><p>I want us to have deep conversations, without trolls, and in a place where we can safely make mistakes as we are learning. Imagine that! You can post something stupid, and you won’t be tarred and feathered for it. You’ll be called out, probably, but in a loving and supportive way. </p><p>Some people don’t think it’s possible to call someone out in a loving and supportive way, but it truly is. </p><p>I have a few friends who I respect enough to do that, and I have a few who respect me enough to do that. These are my favorite people. </p><p>They are all from different areas of my life, too, and so it is exciting to have a place to bring them together. Some friends from the internet, some from work, some from church, some from my communities I’ve lived in, and now, we can all be together and I can introduce my great friends to other great friends. </p><p>Going forward, most posts, comments, and discussions will only be allowed for those who are subscribers. I’d like to hear your voice, so join us. There’s a free trial offer open to any subscribers which must be redeemed by October 31st. </p><p>If you’re not ready for that, I understand.
