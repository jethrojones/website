>My name is Jethro Jones, resident in Fairbanks and school principal in Alaska for the last five years. My whole time in Alaska I have seen budget cuts and had to lay off great, excited, young teachers. It’s hard to find people to teach our kids in Alaska. And harder still with budget cuts looming. While the PFD may be important it should not be a choice between funding public education or cutting education by 25% in order to pay for the PFD. Please honor the commitment made last year to continue forward funding education at high levels so we can meet the needs of our students, the future.


It’s not hard to write a few sentences to advocate for education.
