As part of the masterminds I run for school leaders, we read books. Leaders are readers. 

It's important to read. 

I've recently started having members suggest books. Below is the set of instructions they get as they choose a book to read. 

There are a couple agreements for the mastermind books: 

1.  No education books. We all read plenty of education books. Our focus in the mastermind is to choose books that will teach us something most education books won’t. There is value in translating a topic of a book to education for us. It helps us find something we wouldn’t have otherwise found. 
2.  Books that challenge our status quo help us be transformative. So, reading books that might make us uncomfortable is ok. 
3.  Actionable - Books that we read in the mastermind should help us improve our leadership. Actionable books give us things to do. They help us take action.
4.  Book length doesn’t matter. Only the content does. Most book “studies” are about 4-6 weeks. We should take the time needed for good books, and get what we can out of other books, and move on. You can make the book study as long as it needs to be for the book you are choosing. 
5.  You’re not teaching the book. The purpose of the book study is for us to discuss the book. Ask questions that teach us how to understand and implement the book. 

I’ll update this if there are other things we learn! :) 

Use the table below to help you organize your book study. Feel free to adjust this however you need to for the book you choose.
