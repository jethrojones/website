In the last post, <a href="http://lyndabanksweb2.blogspot.com/">Lynda</a> asked a bunch of questions about the iPods. I want to answer them here, because it will help me reflect more.<br /><br />1) How many students are sharing these 3 iPods?<br />The students are arranged into guided reading groups of 5 or 6. They rotate to different stations around the room, and they use the iPods and share them during that station. So, two people share an iPod.<br /><br />2) What apps are loaded on the ipods?<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284499993&amp;mt=8">eReader</a> - an e-book reader app.<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284956128&amp;mt=8">Stanza</a> - another e-book reader app.<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=287712243&amp;mt=8">Wurdle</a> - A Yatzhee-type of word game.<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285684741&amp;mt=8">Word Whirl</a> - You get seven letters and you have to make words that are from 3 to 7 letter long.<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289322538&amp;mt=8">World Wiki</a> - A wiki for every country in the world.<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=286269540&amp;mt=8">American Heritage Desk Dictionary</a> - Apparently a pretty popular dictionary. Who knew?<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289320718&amp;mt=8">Declaration</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288657710&amp;mt=8">Constitution</a> - Some historical documents that most people feel are pretty important.<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288167168&amp;mt=8">iFlipr Lite</a> - Flashcard app.<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=290008445&amp;mt=8">Flashcards</a> - A good flashcard app that allows you to add pictures and photos to the flashcards. Very much worth the $2.99<br /><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=286892396&amp;mt=8">Kid Book Envi</a> - This is a cool app that allows you to read kids' books. Very cool.<br />There are a lot of great apps and I will probably buy more, because there are so many neat things.<br /><br />3) How long is an ipod "session"?<br />They get 10 minutes at each station, so 10 minutes on the iPods.<br /><br />4) How do you decide who uses the ipod? Is there a schedule? Is it time-based, or project-based?<br />That is, does a slower student get more time than a quicker student?<br />This is a good question, and I think that the students feel the best about the situation when they all get equal time on the iPods. One of the apps on there is a book reading app, and I may use that more in the future with the guided reading.<br /><br />5) Is time on the ipod used as a perk or reward?<br />This is a touchy area of using technology. Technology is a privilege, not a right. I really want to use technology, and it is easier and more enjoyable for me, and so I try to not take it away. Well, these guided reading groups are not really easier, but they are worth it. I have had to take away the reading groups from one class, and I made that the punishment, not taking away the iPods.<br /><br />6) What is the ideal ratio of students per iPod?<br />Ideally, I would want to have 1 student per iPod, but I don't think that is the best way to do it. I think having 2 kids on each iPod is good because they keep each other on task.<br /><br />7) Does the student do work on the iPod? On a computer? On paper?<br />They do work on all three. Most of the work on the iPods have been watching instructional videos, where I am teaching something that I recorded previously and loaded onto the iPod.<br /><br />8) Do you download podcasts from the iTunes store?<br />I have downloaded a movies from iTunesU that relate to the book that we are reading, <a href="http://www.rodmanphilbrick.com/teaching.html#freak">Freak the Mighty</a>. There are a lot of useful things from the iTunesU K-12 section that I will use, I am sure.<br /><br />9) Are the students creating their own podcasts? If so, are they audio only? Video?<br />They eventually will create some sort of podcast, but that probably won't be done on the iPods unless I can get some microphones that work.<br /><br />I hope these answers are satisfactory for you. If anybody has any ideas, feel free to let me know.<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
