I saw a stat about a public school that raised graduation rates from 55% to 82%.

Here’s the problem: raising graduation rates in most situations means “We found a way to get kids to sit in their chairs longer!”

We need to change school, not keep kids in their seats longer.

A high school graduation means a kid sat in a chair for a certain number of hours.

When are we going to start talking about how to make sure kids are ready for life after high school?
