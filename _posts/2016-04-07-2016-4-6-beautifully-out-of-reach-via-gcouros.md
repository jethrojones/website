[Beautifully Out of Reach | Connected Principals](http://connectedprincipals.com/archives/12439)


>The moment we feel we have “arrived”, is the moment we might as well pack it in and call it career. As education develops and we know more about learning, we will constantly be reaching for a target that is seemingly, and beautifully, just out of our reach.



This is great. We need to be responsible for our own learning. It doesn't matter how old we are. We need to be in charge. There's a great quote from Stephen Downes in that post, too.
