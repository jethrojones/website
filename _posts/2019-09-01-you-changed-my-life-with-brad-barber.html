At the Tesla Academy, they coach students rather than teach them.</p> <ul> <li>We are an academy, not a school.</li> <li>Agnostic about the school kids attend, it just needs to be good.</li> <li>We can react very quickly and give support to kids.</li> <li>We diagnose their problems.</li> <li>Sometimes they take notes to impress someone else.</li> <li>When you get into the business world, you have to learn really rapidly.</li> <li>Why would kids want to come to the Tesla Academy?</li> <li>It feels so weird to do something different.</li> <li>Thereâ€™s a generation gap in parents: younger parents totally get it.</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal?
