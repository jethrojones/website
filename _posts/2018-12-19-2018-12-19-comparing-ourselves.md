A couple weeks ago I posted about 
[not comparing yourself](http://www.jethrojones.com/blog/2018/12/9/dont-compare-yourselves-to-others) to others, and I have been thinknig a lot about that lately. Is this a natural human tendency? Probably.

I think it is also engrained in us through our educational process in the United States. Our system is set up to encourage kids to compare themselves to each other.

I had a conversation with someone the other day who said that nearly every young adult they work with is experience depression or anxiety.

If we seek our worth from comparing ourself to others, we are always going to find someone better than us, and that can be depressing.

Your value is not in your grades, your athletic skill, your looks, or anything else. You are valuable because you are a daughter or a son. Certainly of your parents, but more importantly because you a child of God.
