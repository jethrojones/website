I mentioned <a href="http://twentyfivedays.wordpress.com/">this website earlier</a> and wanted to mention it again. My class has gone to great lengths to set the day aside to help raise rice for the United Nations. They wrote a proposal to the administration, they planned out a schedule, made permission slips to teachers, and passes back from the library. I am so proud of how hard they worked. So, a lot of students will be filtering into the library to go to <a href="http://freerice.com/">Freerice.com</a> and see how much rice we can to donate to the United Nations. The totals for the past few days are in the image below.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXu9HBpHleJ3fNMt1yo0ZSgKH1f5DsXT8sc2F4lXm9vrLsgXkK-AiPNkIXBxfjy2a2OkFNSVHuDaZ9SAWp42NrZPR7qNf1ob5aOdP_wX65i2Q7xYjNARqwlQEXWZg3WYTKb4IB5jXrWzH_/s1600-h/Picture+1.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXu9HBpHleJ3fNMt1yo0ZSgKH1f5DsXT8sc2F4lXm9vrLsgXkK-AiPNkIXBxfjy2a2OkFNSVHuDaZ9SAWp42NrZPR7qNf1ob5aOdP_wX65i2Q7xYjNARqwlQEXWZg3WYTKb4IB5jXrWzH_/s400/Picture+1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5145550581086829506" border="0" /></a><br /><br />If you have a chance, please spend a couple minutes there and pad our stats. ;)<br /><br />My students would really appreciate your help.<br /><br />In other news. The <a href="http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/">SWAT team wiki</a> is up and running. It looks great. The students have done almost all of that all by themselves. They are doing a remarkable job! Stay posted for the website for gratitude if we can ever figure out how to get the form to work.
