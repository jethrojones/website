If you go waaaayyy back in the 
[Transformative Principal](http://transformativeprincipal.org/past-episodes) archives, to 
[episode 5, my interview with Sandrda Dahl-Houlihan](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/episode-005-sandra-dahl-houlihan/), you'll hear that she gave me some great advice. She said that she writes a personal card to each adult in her building every year between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Ever since that interview, I have done that. It's been great, and I know that people appreciate it.

It's a tradition that reminds me to see people as people and take time to think about what it is that makes me care about them as human beings.

All too often, we breeze past that important information.

This year will be extra special, as my amazing wife made cards for me to give to them, as you can see in this picture of my messy desk below.
