<p>"Puritans, who first settled New England in 1620, saw in moral education a way to keep religious orthodoxy alive, promote social harmony, encourage hard work, and spread the Christian faith to the heathen."&nbsp;McClellan, B. E. (1999). Moral education in America: Schools and the shaping of character from colonial times to the present. Teachers College Press&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The question of whether education should be viewed as a transmission of culture is a complex one, deeply intertwined with the role of the state, the family, and the values that are implicitly or explicitly conveyed through educational systems. The quote from McClellan's "Moral Education in America" serves as a historical lens, highlighting how the Puritans used education as a tool to perpetuate their religious and moral beliefs. This historical context is not an isolated example; it reflects a broader pattern where education has often been used as a vehicle for transmitting cultural, moral, and social norms. First, we must understand that we will transmit values. Second, The state's role is to support value development, centered in the family. Finally, we must be partners in helping families support students in establishing their own values. </p><p>First, it's important to acknowledge that whether we intend to or not, values and beliefs are transmitted through educational systems. This is evident in various instances, such as the case of the pro-Antifa teacher who was reportedly going to be fired, as mentioned in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/02/pro-antifa-teacher-gabriel-gipe-reportedly-will-be-fired/">New York Post</a>, or the teacher who was fired for allegedly calling MLK Jr. Day "Black Privilege Day," as reported by <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/teacher-fired-after-allegedly-calling-mlk-jr-day-black-privilege-day-1606191">Newsweek</a>. </p><p>These examples illustrate that the act of teaching is never neutral; it is imbued with the values, beliefs, and biases of those who are in the position to educate. As I pointed out in my [Substack post](https://jethrojones.substack.com/p/education-is-the-responsibility-of), the values we transmit are not just confined to the curriculum but are also reflected in the actions and words of educators. </p><p>The error these negative examples of teachers who were fired made was trying to impose their own beliefs on students. One veteran teacher told me that she knew she was winning if students couldn't tell if she were liberal or conservative. </p><p>Secondly, the state's role in education should be that of a supporter rather than the main actor. While it is necessary for the state to provide a framework for education, it should not overstep its boundaries by dictating what values should be instilled in students. The state's role should be to create an environment where diverse values can coexist and where families have the freedom to impart their beliefs and values to their children.</p><p>Lastly, the state should focus on supporting families in developing their values rather than determining what values should be disseminated through the educational system. Families are the primary social units where values are first learned and internalized. Therefore, any educational system that aims to be truly effective should work in tandem with families, respecting their role in value formation.</p><p>Education has always been and will continue to be a medium through which culture and values are transmitted. However, the role of the state should be that of a facilitator, providing a platform where diverse beliefs can be explored rather than imposing a monolithic set of values. By recognizing and respecting the primary role families play in value formation, we can create an educational system that is both inclusive and effective in preparing students for the complexities of the world they will inherit.</p>
