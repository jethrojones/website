You will enjoy every minute of it! We talk about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to deal with cynical stakeholders.</li>
<li>Why people need to be ready to change to make things better.</li>
<li>How to make a good school even better.</li>
<li>Why you wake up with panic attacks in the middle of the night as a transformative principal.</li>
<li>The best time to change education was 20 years ago, the second best time to change education is today!</li>
<li>The excuses we make to not make changes.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as an optimal time to make changes, but we need to have a sense of urgency.</li>
<li>The state of Utah lost 19% of students (that didn&rsquo;t graduate with a diploma). That is 1 in 5 kids! Unacceptable!</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t find a better way&hellip; You fall back to how you did it before. We need to focus on using research-based best practices to help our students.</li>
<li>The importance of the Professional Learning Communities and Response to Intervention.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t need to find new things, we just need to get good at PLCs and RTI.</li>
<li>There is no quick fix for schools.</li>
<li>We need to remove the things that</li>
<li>A super quick overview of PLCs and RTI in case you aren&rsquo;t familiar with them. Based mostly on the work of DuFour and Eaker in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935542095/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1935542095&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jethrojonesco-20&amp;linkId=ZF5BJSVAAHAGL6FT">Learning by Doing</a></li>
<li>What a principal can do to be a transformative principal today: Identify the research that drives your day-to-day work and recognize the sense of urgency we have to ensure that learning is not optional.</li>
<li>What he has in his office or a story: Simplify and focus. Story about teacher telling him that he is right in pushing forward.</li>
<li>How to get ahold of him (He is not on the Twitter, but he is willing to help you by giving his email address. Bob [dot] sonju at wash.k12.ut.us)</li>
</ul>
