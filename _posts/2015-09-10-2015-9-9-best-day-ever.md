[Through a Child’s Eyes… It Was the Best Day Ever | The Wejr Board](http://chriswejr.com/2015/09/09/through-a-childs-eyes-it-was-the-best-day-ever/)


>A few months ago, I was away for a few days and I texted my wife and asked how the day was. She said that our girls had a really rough day filled with meltdowns, tears, fights, and frustration. I felt for her as I can only imagine how hard it is for my wife to run her business and look after twin preschoolers by herself… especially during a day full of meltdowns and tears. The interesting thing was that when I Facetimed my girls at bedtime, it was a very different story of the day.  They eagerly told me they went for a bike ride, they swam, they baked cookies, they read stories… and they told me it was “The Best. Day. Ever!!!”.



Teaching and parenting are truly difficult. But kids are amazing and typically see the best in the world. Oh, that we could all be like that.
