>New opportunities to move this project forward at a faster rate have surfaced.  We learned that we need to have a fully functional greenhouse up and running by the beginning of March to be ready for the growing season in April.  In the interest of time, we ordered a prefab greenhouse that we can get set up and running by March.  We will still be doing renovations on the current KHS greenhouse as time allows.



One of my teachers is doing nano agriculture with her students. BAM! She is awesome and this is a pretty exciting opportunity.
