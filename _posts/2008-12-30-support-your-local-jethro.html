I sold my car the other day so I could buy a new computer. I decided that I could make a better living by working on my own business from home, and so I decided to quit my job, effective immediately. Since I no longer had a car, my friend had to drive me to buy this new computer. It's icy out there...That is the premise for the movie I made a couple weeks ago. I made it to enter it into a contest online. There are not that many other movies, and the best 9 movies will be chosen from the top 20 as the winners. Judging by my competition, I think I have a pretty good shot. <a href="http://www.computernightmare.com/contests/showentry/38965">Here is the video, watch it, sign up for an account, and vote on my video</a>. There is a good privacy policy, so you don't have to worry about them selling your information. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhCZ5_E_eEVoOCMGqey9IVY2THrTBav-LK9cKWO9-IWyPbpUTGbeU8dh8jNr1mFmFcPW05OTErSGkF2ROASm5fqJOgoA2k3NDN8w5slKKiwil4rOsR_-m5kYV8_Mx3SvwIcL2XOfhGiphU/s1600-h/cn.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 292px;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhCZ5_E_eEVoOCMGqey9IVY2THrTBav-LK9cKWO9-IWyPbpUTGbeU8dh8jNr1mFmFcPW05OTErSGkF2ROASm5fqJOgoA2k3NDN8w5slKKiwil4rOsR_-m5kYV8_Mx3SvwIcL2XOfhGiphU/s400/cn.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285251272051458482" /></a><br /><br />Mozy is the company that is sponsoring this contest. I use the company for my online backup. They provide 2 GB of free backup for anyone on their home computer. It is automated, so you tell it what folders or files you want backed up, and it will upload them to the backup servers every night. I like that because I have all my work and grad school files backed up, and then I don't have to worry about losing them. If my hard drive fails, I won't lose all those documents. Here is a <a href="https://mozy.com/?code=R88V4K">referral link</a>, click on the free 2 GB link on the right side of the page, and you will get 256 MB free on top of your 2 GB.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjL3Bif4FRHuLz0SQYQuN6qu7tc96osvklFk8fvivnxHyHG3U6PNZOi-Ozxlr8Z55zHcHl9nzzunzTi-yVwASVuKmP_68iOBb1gSPW7ljQDty2h_qvrXVoWu7FtSFbs7umGLfBnf6EyNX7/s1600-h/mozy.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 218px;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjL3Bif4FRHuLz0SQYQuN6qu7tc96osvklFk8fvivnxHyHG3U6PNZOi-Ozxlr8Z55zHcHl9nzzunzTi-yVwASVuKmP_68iOBb1gSPW7ljQDty2h_qvrXVoWu7FtSFbs7umGLfBnf6EyNX7/s400/mozy.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285253420074727298" /></a>
