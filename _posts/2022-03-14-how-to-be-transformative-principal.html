Take care of yourself because YOU matter.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Support for them, Support for you <ul> <li>Support doesn’t always mean what you think it does. We’ll talk about how to have difficult conversations, how to understand your staff better, and how to help them be the best they can. In order to support others, you have to have support yourself. This program is a good start!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Delegation <ul> <li>We usually speak of strengths and delegation in terms of tasks. We need to start thinking in terms of people.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Vision <ul> <li>At the end of the calendar year, but in the middle of the school year, we address the vision. Is your school achieving your vision, or is it taking the path of least resistance?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Observations <ul> <li>Observations are not for evaluation! The evaluation is a nice way to summarize your observations. Observations are for measuring how well your vision is implemented.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Communication <ul> <li>Communication is not just about you speaking to others. It’s a two-way street, fraught with potholes, car accidents, and detours.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Relationships <ul> <li>Relationships can make or break a school. You’ll learn how to build good, strong, healthy relationships and how to maintain them, even through difficult conversations. You can’t force anyone to do anything, you can only invite.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Hiring <ul> <li>It’s never too early to talk about hiring. The earlier you have a plan, the better.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Culture <ul> <li>Culture is the foundation of everything in a school, but there is so much to it, it can be overwhelming. We’ll talk about how to make it work with small steps that make a difference.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Why Jethro took so long to write the book</li> <li>Launch Party</li> </ul> <br /><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/cybertraps/Cybertraps_117_How2be.mp3?dest-id=2561582">Check out this episode!</a></p>
