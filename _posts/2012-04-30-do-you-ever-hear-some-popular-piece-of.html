Do you ever hear some popular piece of wisdom and think, "Duh! I learned that in Primary"? I do. All the time. I read a lot of research for work. It seems that most research is common sense and if we just think about it for a couple minutes, we could come to the same conclusion. We can usually come to that conclusion because we were already taught it, by our primary teachers.<br />
<br />
My point is, Jesus is the source of all truth, and so new research will almost always lead back to His gospel. That is the point of <a href="http://learnedinprimary.com/">learnedinprimary.com</a>. There, I take the research that I am reading, and I apply it to lessons that I have already learned, long ago.<br />
<br />
Go on <a href="http://learnedinprimary.com/">over</a> and check it out. Let me know what you think. I publish a new post every Monday. If you have any requests, <a href="http://learnedinprimary.com/contact/">let me know</a>.
