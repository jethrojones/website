<strong>News Item: In June 2021, UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson suggested banning mobile phones in schools</strong><br /> - He argued that a ban would help students “remain calm” and overcome the effects of the pandemic<br /> - Some schools expressed opposition, saying individual schools and districts should establish their own policies without government mandate<br /> - Williamson seen as strong opponent of mobile phones in school, pointing to cyberbullying, sexting, and abuse of girls.<br /> - Officials acknowledged that an in-school ban would do little to prevent harm occurring outside of school<br /> - [Note: Williamson subsequently lost his position during a cabinet re-shuffle in September 2021]<br /> - Several countries have limits on in-school mobile use, including:<br /> - Afghanistan<br /> - Australia<br /> - China<br /> - France<br /> - Reframe the Discussion?<br /> - Educators should not view these devices as mere “phones” or communication tools<br /> - Instead, they should be recognized as powerful pocket computers and integrated into education accordingly<br /> - <strong>“A plan, not a ban”</strong><br /> - Input from students and parents<br /> - Negative Effects of Phones<br /> - Full extent of potential problems still being analyzed<br /> - 2013 study<br /> - students not using cellphones:<br /> - wrote an average of 62 percent more in their notes<br /> - wrote more detailed notes<br /> - recalled more detailed information<br /> - scored one-and-a-half letter-grades higher on assessments<br /> - students with digital devices:<br /> - engage in more off-task behavior<br /> - have more concentration and focus issues<br /> - have a higher incidence of physical and mental health issues.<br /> - 2015 study<br /> - banning mobile phones led to an increase in test scores by an average of 6.4%<br /> - “This is equivalent to adding five days to the school year or an additional hour a week.”<br /> - Greater benefits (2x) for low-performing students<br /> - Similar results from studies in Spain and Norway<br /> - Excessive use can lead to multiple harms, including:<br /> - anxiety and depression<br /> - neglecting other activities<br /> - conflict with peers or parents<br /> - poor sleep habits (sleep deprivation and sleep texting)<br /> - increased exposure to cyberbullying<br /> - poor decision making<br /> - physical harms, including posture, repetitive stress syndrome, vision, etc.<br /> - learning disabilities<br /> - FOMO or cyberchondria(?)<br /> - emotional dysregulation<br /> - decline in conversation skills<br /> - Positive Uses of Smartphones<br /> - keep track of homework<br /> - setting up other reminders<br /> - looking up facts and formulas<br /> - taking photos, videos, or audio of lessons or confusing topics<br /> - note-taking<br /> - accessing education apps<br /> - Impact on the classroom environment and school community<br /> - mobile devices change dynamic between educator and student<br /> - can be used to record and report educator misconduct<br /> - can also be used to harass or embarrass educators<br /> - Are mobile devices (and other digital tools) changing the way students learn?<br /> - Suggestions on mitigating negative impacts of mobile devices<br /> - More sleep<br /> - More playtime (especially outdoors)<br /> - Less time on digital media<br /> - Read more books<br /> - Develop a regular writing habit<br /> - Resources<br /> - #2021–10–30 David Lammy: Ban smartphone use in schools<br /> <a href= "https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/david-lammy/david-lammy-ban-smartphone-use-in-schools/"> https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/david-lammy/david-lammy-ban-smartphone-use-in-schools/</a><br />  -
