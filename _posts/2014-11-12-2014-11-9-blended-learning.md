>Blended learning is not about ‘adding’ digital media and digital tools. Blended learning is about creating meaningful learning experiences that leverage advantages of face-to-face experiences with advantages of digital interactions.



Technology and other instructional strategies are not the ends in and of themselves, yet we often see them that way.
