Hi Team,


Welcome to our last week before spring break! It’s going to be a great week.


**Upcoming Calendar Events**


Today, we will have an assembly in the Gym during Tutorials. We are going to kick off our spring fundraiser and it is all about Mady. 
[Read about her story here](https://www.booster.com/team-maddy-sweatshirts?share=4981488609606860&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_content=team-maddy-sweatshirts&utm_campaign=mobile-post-purchase-share-modal-v1-2&ref=facebook_social_mobile-post-purchase-share-modal-v1-2&type&side). She is a great student at our school who is really experiencing a heartbreaking situation: her arm will be amputated on Wednesday. Up until last week, she was going to get a new implant, but the FDA didn’t approve it, so we are going to raise our money to help her family with the bills.


We are going to kick it off with an assembly today. Please take attendance in tutorials and then bring your students down to the gym.


Tonight, there is an opportunity to 
[meet the Superintendent](http://www.kibsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=333&ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=3128&PageID=1) candidates from 3:45 to 5:00 pm in the choral pods.


Choir concert tomorrow at 7 pm.


There is a PTSA meeting on Wednesday night at 5:30 in room 104.


**Resources**


Here are the 
[shared resources from our Proficiency Scales Training](https://kibsd-my.sharepoint.com/personal/khanisch01_kibsd_org/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?folderid=11ae5bdc33fc540cba9d7c99cb3726fad&authkey=AVGINkEQ16WZyZYlGEPrxVM) last Friday.


Our Tardy Data that I mentioned last week 
[has been updated for the full month of February](https://kibsd-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jjones03_kibsd_org/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=VnVtoT3b65mFm1PQwSH9wZpKBC%2bygCPI1b34Bxx2Mvw%3d&docid=2_07234ce76ecc049bda62d9a7359ca4074&rev=1), and I included grade level data as well. You will see that 6th grade is remarkably consistent in their tardies.
