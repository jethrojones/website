>It is incumbent on the adults to not settle for the statement, “My [child/student/friend's kid] doesn’t like school.” We have to unpack the “why” behind that statement and work to fix it.
  
  
It’s not on the kids to love school. It’s on all of us to create joyful, profound, empowering spaces in school that are easy to fall in love with.



So true. It is easy to forget this.
