Be sure to hit the SWAT team wiki link above to see how the class is doing. The temporary site for the "website for gratitude" is <a href="http://jethrojones.com/gratitude.html">here</a>. It was designed by my students, and I will let them take the reins on it. <br /><br />Also, here is a neat little video about blogs. It is so well done and very creative. I love how it doesn't use any screenshots or visit any webpages to teach about blogs. So cool!<br /><br /><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NN2I1pWXjXI&rel=1&border=0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NN2I1pWXjXI&rel=1&border=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>
