Most principals are running from one emergency to the next. I help principals find the actions needed to transform their schools so each student has an amazing experience.

As an acting principal, I know there is is never enough time to do all that is your todo list, let alone transform your school to make it even better for students and teachers.

Each week, I interview a principal or other leader to help you refocus and find something that can improve your school.


Listening to the podcast each week will give you actionable advice to change your world in a positive way.

Here's the top 3 episodes to get you started:


* [Learner Centered Innovation with Katie Martin](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s5/241) - Katie and I discuss how to make your innovations more focused on the students. It's a powerful discussion.
* [Creating a Gradeless Classroom when Grades are Still Required](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s5/231) - Andrew Burnett and I discuss how you can be innovative, even when district mandates seem to make that impossible.
* [The 1 Thing](https://transformativeprincipal.org/s5/bonus206) - In this episode, I interview Geoff Woods of The 1 Thing podcast, and we talk about how to be focused enough to get your most important work done.

You can take it to the next level by joining the [Mastermind](https://transformativeprincipal.com), a weekly group coaching experience that helps you solve your biggest challenges with support.
