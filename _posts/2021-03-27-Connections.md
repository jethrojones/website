For the past several years, I’ve seen some amazing things. I’ve been able to move to Alaska, win a national award, and do things I love doing with cool people. 

It’s pretty amazing. 

The one thing that all the good things have in common? 

Connections. 

I’m not talking about good ol’ boys clubs, because I often get kicked out of those. 

I’m talking about personal connections. I take meetings with virtually everyone that asks, even though people even in my lowly state say no, because I believe in the power of connections. 

Being able to serve others is a great honor. If I can serve other people, I believe that I can live a life that is worthy.
