Doug Timm:


>When having a conversation a message is going to be sent, make sure it is the message that you want to send.  Don't derail your conversation/feedback before is starts by picking the wrong approach or having no approach at all.  This is so crucial as we try to build trusting relationships with those we work WITH.  



Great points here.
