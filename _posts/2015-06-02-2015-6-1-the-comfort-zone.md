Richard Bruford:


>Last weekend was the third time my son, Austin, stepped out on his rollerblades. His first two times were frustrating for him and the start of our rollerblading activity last weekend was no different. “I cannot get my feet to do what I want them to do,” he said before the tears began to flow. He wanted to give up, he wanted to go home and watch TV, Austin wanted to get back in his comfort zone.



How often do we feel like this? It is easy to want to stay in a comfort zone. It is much more difficult to want to get out of it.
