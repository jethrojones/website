There is an ancient proverb, some attribute to the Russians, others to the Chinese:

“He who chases two rabbits catches none!”

When deciding what our focuses are in school, we need to narrow it down as much as we can.

One focus.

At my school, everything serves personalizing learning. If we’re not doing that, we shouldn’t be spending time on it.

Sometimes, we have to do other things, but everything that I am doing is focused on that one objective.
