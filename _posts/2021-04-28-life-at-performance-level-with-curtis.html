There’s no guesswork in the program because there’s a 21-video progression for each grade level.</p> <p>They’ve thought of everything-- because it’s a group of award winning counselors, teachers, and principals that came up with this thing. It’ll help you save tons of time and headaches.</p> <p>Take it from me, it’s time to check that social-emotional learning box, the empty one that’s been keeping you up at night--and it’s time to do it in a meaningful, measurable, magnetic way.</p> <p>If you go to <a href= "https://www.incontrolsel.com/jethro">www.InControlSEL.com/jethro</a> you can check out some of the videos and even receive 20% off if you pre-order for next school year</p> <h3><a href="https://us.johncattbookshop.com">John Catt</a></h3> <p>Today’s Transformative Principal sponsor, John Catt Educational, amplifies world-class voices on timeless topics, with a list of authors recognized globally for their fresh perspectives and proven strategies to drive success in modern schools and classrooms.</p> <p>John Catt’s mission is to support high-quality teaching and learning by ensuring every educator has access to professional development materials that are research-based, practical, and focused on the key topics proven essential in today’s and tomorrow’s schools.</p> <p>Learn more about professional development publications that are easy to implement for your entire faculty, and are both quickly digestible and rigorous, by visiting https://us.johncattbookshop.com/.
