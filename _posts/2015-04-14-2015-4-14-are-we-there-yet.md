Glenn Robbins:


>We increased instructional time, created/implementation of BYOD, revamped classroom furniture, created a culture that focuses on PBL, genius hour, e-portfolios, created a hallway makerspace during passing, flipped lessons/faculty meetings, provided educational learning advancements for staff by sharing resources, and 20% time to name just a few reforms



I, for one, plan to never be "there". If we ever "make it" what fun is that? I am exhilarated by the idea of constant refinement and iteration.
