How do we replicate that?</li> <li>How to approve partners and facilitate the success of their schools.</li> <li>How do you help kids not blow everything off?</li> <li>In a traditional model, we’ve removed all the opportunities to have kids lead.</li> <li>The first thing to think about is how to empower students.</li> <li>It kills their love for learning.</li> <li>You need to empower students.</li> <li>The second thing is to set up processes for accountability.</li> <li>It’s ok to fail as long as you are failing forward.</li> <li>Every student had a success coach with whom they met every week.</li> <li>Accountability: consequences like losing freedom and stopping college courses.</li> <li>Support: You must have good support systems in place. Lots of processes in place to help them stay on pace and set their goals.</li> <li>Three legs of a stool: Parents, students, school (teachers and administrators)</li> <li>We never apologize for bothering you with communication</li> <li>Four: give them something to be excited about in their pathway: i.e., have your certification when you finished school.</li> <li>The light came back on.</li> <li>The success coach was the real piece of accountability each week. Success coach had constant communication with parents, too.</li> <li>Give recognition with accountability.</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal?
