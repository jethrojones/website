I'd like to reflect on the time I spent at the National Association of Secondary School Principals conference in Orlando, Florida.


I'm sharing my notes below but I first want to say that the best part of my experience down there was meeting all these people that I have been following online for so many years. Seriously, I can't say enough how amazing it was to make those in-person connections. Meeting 
[Will Parker](http://twitter.com/Williamdp) and 
[Glenn Robbins](http://Twitter.com/glennr1809) and Bill Ziegler was just awesome. These guys are Giants to me, and it was so great to meet them and see who they are as humans, in person. It is so great. I also met people that I hadn't followed that I will start following because they were amazing.


People talk about how powerful Twitter (and other social media) is and how worthwhile it is to use. I've been using Twitter since 2007, and have gone through phases of engagement with it. I have learned, however, that Twitter really can be incredibly beneficial. The importance of connecting with people is incredible. It is not just about being ON Twitter, or lurking on Twitter. It is really about connecting with people.


The power of the connection is that you learn how to appreciate the other people, how to learn from them, and how to know how to help them. I'm so glad that I have been on Twitter, and I am sure that I have grown more through those connections than any other professional development I have experienced. I'm lumping my podcast into this because I would not have the idea, success or opportunity to do the podcast if not for my connections on Twitter.


My notes below are largely unedited. Be sure to 
[follow the podcast](http://transformativeprincipal.org) to hear more interviews coming up from people I met there at the conference.  Go

* How is BYOD different from 1:1 initiatives in terms of instruction? Do you focus less on teaching tools and more on teaching concepts?

Need to support each student. Not just the at-risk students. 
We need to establish a mentoring program for each of our students. Mentoring from staff and peers. Everyone is a mentor.


Who could be a peer model? Ask kids, then train the kids they identify.
