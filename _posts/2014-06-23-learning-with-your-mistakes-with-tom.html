<ul>
<li>His mentor that taught him a lot about how to be a leader and how to push yourself and others to be better, book reads, and more.</li>
<li>Professional Learning Communities in Tom&rsquo;s ideal world.</li>
<li>PLCs require a whole philosophy change to be effective.</li>
<li>How to set the stage to be successful in having discussions with teachers. Power of change comes from stories.</li>
<li>Create opportunities for conversation.</li>
<li>How can administrators tell stories? Start with true stories. (Don&rsquo;t make things up.) Provide opportunities for real conversation.</li>
<li>What can we do to make this work, and what will prevent us from being successful?</li>
<li>It is too easy for things to get said behind closed doors, and we need to address challenges early on, and then address issues as they arise.</li>
<li>Focus the conversations on continuous improvement on faculty meeting time.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Jumpstart Fridays&rdquo; - aides and others work with kids so they can do collaboration times.</li>
<li>How Tom gets teachers to feel comfortable sharing their stories with Tom and the other teachers.</li>

<li>We don&rsquo;t get better, unless we can talk about the mistakes that we made.</li>
<li>How Tom figured out that his faculty did not like his strategy for getting them to have fun with his emails. (Background blog post - &ldquo;<a href="http://whittyplcguy.blogspot.com/2014/03/empathy-lost.html">Learning with your mistakes</a>&rdquo;)</li>
