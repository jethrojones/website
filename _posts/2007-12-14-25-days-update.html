Well, my students discussed, brainstormed, and came up with some great ideas for how to make a difference.<br /><br />One girl, the resident genius, suggested what I think is the best idea. She wants to make a website for gratitude. People will be able to go to the website and type in a message of gratitude to someone. The web form will then email that message to the recipient. I think it is a great idea. Hopefully, it will work.<br /><br />The next idea was to do something with <a href="http://freerice.com/">Freerice.com</a>. After talking about it, we decided we would try to have the library full all day with shifts of students trying to raise rice for the United Nations. I think it will work really well, but we might not have enough time.<br /><br />The last idea is one that I came up with, but it will still help. I gave the kids the idea, but they have done most of the work so far. They are making a <a href="http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/">SWAT team wiki</a>. It will be a place that students can go to for information and tutoring. It is a big project, also. We will be working on this all year. I am very excited about it. I did blogs with my students last year, and I think this will be a good thing to do.<br /><br /><a href="http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/" onmousedown="this.href+='t/b/80x15'; this.onmousedown=''; return true;"><img src="http://swatteamwiki.wikispaces.com/i/b/80x15.gif" alt="Wikispaces" border="0" height="15" width="80" /></a>
