Today, the Transformative Leadership Summit is sponsored by GCI, a global communications company with headquarters in Anchorage, AK. They provide a lot of amazing resources and connectivity for schools, especially here in Alaska. If you’re interested in how they can help your school connect with the world around them, please go to 
[gci.com/education](http://gci.com/education) for more information.

We have some fantastic sessions for you today where we will be diving deeper into the administrator experience which helps principals take what they learn and apply it!

Here's some feedback from yesterday:

"Powerful conversations about...talking failure with our students" - 
[Martin](https://gc319.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/3987/3c02f94a82caa671/96919/2b44bd5ad0df7206)

From Kimberly: "Holy Moly Anthony Muhammad's administrator's experience message on TLS--nailed it! Going to check out that book he recommended LEADING SCHOOLS IN A DATA RICH WORLD by Earl & Katz as well as going back and re-read chapter 7 in his book [Transforming School Culture]."

And one more from

First up is 
[Jeff Zoul](https://gc319.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/3951/a6248f56e6e7ea78/96919/2b44bd5ad0df7206), who will talk about 
**relationships, and building a culture where diversity and dissent are valued and appreciated**
. He will also give some suggestions on how to curb bullying behavior by students, and you will be surprised by where he says that behavior starts!

Next we will hear from 
[Jennifer Abrams](https://gc319.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/3953/86644b641080b1ad/96919/2b44bd5ad0df7206). One of the 
[bonuses she included for those who purchase the All Access Pass](https://gc319.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/3961/3503c1ff1ece561d/96919/2b44bd5ad0df7206) is a video about having hard conversations. And while she is one of Education’s experts on hard conversations, she knows how to have them appropriately and without modeling yelling and bullying.

[Nicholas Fischer](https://gc319.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/3955/420c7dad5d19e492/96919/2b44bd5ad0df7206) is going to talk about 
**coaching teachers, training teachers to recognize behavior**
, and how to have hard conversations 
**when others on your team are not able to have those hard conversations**
. He will talk about modeling for your teachers what you want them to do with your students.

Finally, 
[Tom Hierck](https://gc319.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/3957/8ce8926febdfff8f/96919/2b44bd5ad0df7206) will talk about 
**encouraging all the voices**
. In this video today, we will learn about 
**how to get clarity around your WHY in your school**
. Here’s the truth, it takes time! So be prepared. But just because it takes time, doesn’t mean you can’t get started.
