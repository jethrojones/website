>In an airport in Amsterdam a few years back, officials wrestled with this very problem. Without spending enormous amounts of money on research and the design of a new toilet, they wanted to know what they could do keep that annoying (and disgusting) mess off the floors. An economist that worked for the airport had a brilliant solution: etch a little housefly into the bowls and give the guys something to aim at. And you know what the result was? An 80% reduction in spillage! (Iâ€™d hate to be the guy who had to research the before-and-after statistics on that).



I LOVE this idea. Public restrooms for men are awful. This is a brilliant, simple solution. Just the
