Several years ago, [Amy Fast](https://twitter.com/fastcrayon), a principal in McMinnville, Oregon, said something profound to me. I didn’t understand it [fully at the time](https://transformativeprincipal.org/episode133), but I’ve repeated it to hundreds of people at this point.

She said, “In fact, I wouldn't even say we need to fill their cups as a means to an end. Like let's not fill their cups so that they can give to students, but let's fill their cups because they're human beings and they deserve it.”

Let’s serve our teachers because they are human beings and they deserve that by virtue of the fact that they are human beings. 

This is important. 

As humans, we are too often transactional. We try to see what the benefit is for us if we do something a certain way.   
We try to find the justification for doing something when we often don’t need to do that. 

We just need to do the right thing. 

As a leader in a school, we are surrounded by people we can serve. We need to remember that we are not in a job for our own benefit.
