George Couros:


>But here is my confessionâ€¦Although I have a minor in English I have never read a novel from end-to-end.



And George has written many novels-worth of content on his blog. He has told great stories as well as provided plenty of volumes of educationally rich material.


Towards the end of his post, George asks if school gets in the way of or enhances learning. Sometimes, it does get in the way.
