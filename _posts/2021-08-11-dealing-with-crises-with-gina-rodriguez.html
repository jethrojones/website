Proud graduate of the University of Texas at El Paso. Received my Bachelors of Interdisciplinary Studies, Bachelors of Liberals Arts. Masters of Education<br /> I was an assistant principal for 7 years. I was named principal of Tippin elementary in 2009. I have served the Tippin community for 12 years.</p> <p>Raised by two hard working parents who immigrated to the US after they were married. My mother was a stay-at-home mother and my father worked at a break making factory. When I entered school I only spoke Spanish. I am a product of the bilingual program in EPISD. I later became a bilingual teacher and now a supporter of the EPISD dual language program.</p> <p>I am married and have 3 amazing children. While I am not being a principal I enjoy spending time with my children, traveling and reading.</p> <ul> <li>Brittni’s situation taught me a lot about my role as an administrator.</li> <li>Being present for them</li> <li>What can the school do for you?</li> <li>It’s easy to shy away from situations like that.</li> <li>You have to listen to what people are saying, and then you have to listen to your own heart and your own feelings.</li> <li>Really need to take care of our faculty and staff.</li> <li>Put yourself out there.</li> <li>How to put the heart component into leadership.</li> <li>Someone being there for me.</li> <li>How to take care of yourself when tragedy strikes - talk with other people.</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal?

There’s no guesswork in the program because there’s a 21-video progression for each grade level.</p> <p>They’ve thought of everything– because it’s a group of award winning counselors, teachers, and principals that came up with this thing. It’ll help you save tons of time and headaches.</p> <p>Take it from me, it’s time to check that social-emotional learning box, the empty one that’s been keeping you up at night–and it’s time to do it in a meaningful, measurable, magnetic way.</p> <p>If you go to <a href= "https://www.incontrolsel.com/jethro">www.InControlSEL.com/jethro</a> you can check out some of the videos and even receive 20% off if you pre-order for next school year</p> <h3 id="johncatt"><a href="https://us.johncattbookshop.com">John Catt</a></h3> <p>Today’s Transformative Principal sponsor, John Catt Educational, amplifies world-class voices on timeless topics, with a list of authors recognized globally for their fresh perspectives and proven strategies to drive success in modern schools and classrooms.</p> <p>John Catt’s mission is to support high-quality teaching and learning by ensuring every educator has access to professional development materials that are research-based, practical, and focused on the key topics proven essential in today’s and tomorrow’s schools.</p> <p>Learn more about professional development publications that are easy to implement for your entire faculty, and are both quickly digestible and rigorous, by visiting https://us.johncattbookshop.com/.<br /> Learn more about some of the newest titles:<br /> - <em><a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/products/the-coach-s-guide-to-teaching?_pos=2&amp;_sid=0405c747f&amp;_ss=r"> The Coach’s Guide to Teaching</a></em> by Doug Lemov</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-feedback-pendulum-a-manifesto-for-enhancing-feedback-in-education"> <em>The Feedback Pendulum: A manifesto for enhancing feedback in education</em></a> by Michael Chiles</p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/products/putting-staff-first-a-blueprint-for-revitalising-our-schools?_pos=1&amp;_sid=7dc3400e3&amp;_ss=r"> Putting Staff First: A blueprint for revitalising our schools</a></em> by John Tomsett and Jonny Uttley</p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/collections/frontpage/products/10-things-schools-get-wrong-and-how-we-can-get-them-right"> 10 Things Schools Get Wrong (And How We Can Get Them Right)</a></em> by Jared Cooney Horvath and David Bott</p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/collections/frontpage/products/let-s-talk-about-flex-flipping-the-flexible-working-narrative-for-education"> Let’s Talk About Flex: Flipping the flexible working narrative for education</a></em> by Emma Turner</p> </li> <li> <p><em><a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/products/powerful-teaching-a-guide-for-parents?_pos=1&amp;_sid=7bf6ec56e&amp;_ss=r"> A Parent’s Guide to Powerful Teaching</a></em> by Patrice Bain</p> </li> </ul> <p>John Catt is also proud publisher of the new book from Transformative Principal host Jethro Jones: <a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/collections/frontpage/products/schoolx-how-principals-can-design-a-transformative-school-experience-for-students-teachers-parents-and-themselves"> SchoolX: How principals can design a transformative school experience for students, teachers, parents – and themselves</a><br /> Visit this page to learn more about bulk orders and how to bring John Catt’s research-based materials to your school: https://us.johncattbookshop.com/pages/agents-and-distributors</p> <br /><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jethrojones.com/podcast/episode438">New Episode of @TrnFrmPrincipal</a></p>
