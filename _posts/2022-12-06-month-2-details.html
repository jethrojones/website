Astute readers will have some idea of what AMC stock did this summer and fall! I’ll get to that soon, don’t worry! </p><p>Total passive income for Month 2: $215</p><p>Total money invested so far: $2202</p><p>Total passive income for 2022: $271.88</p><p>Monthly rate of return: 9.76%</p><p>Yearly cumulative rate of return: 12.29%</p><p>This month I got into AMC, and the premiums were much higher. Remember, I’m not giving financial advice, just showing you how this works. </p><p>If you want to try yourself, you can use my Robinhood link and get started with some small amount of free stock!</p><p>I’ve only been doing this two months. I still don’t know what I’m doing. I still don’t know exactly how it works, but I know that it does work, because I’m seeing the money. </p><p>A note about the numbers, When I share how much I’m investing, I’m sharing the actual cash that I’m putting in. This is important because at some point, the money that I have made will actually enable me to do more things that I could not do before. </p><p>For example, with the $200 I made this month, I was able to buy another 100 shares of BBIG, because its price was low. </p><p>Let me talk for a moment about my mindset. I don’t know what I’m doing but I saw something good happen last month, so I’m taking action. Again, this is a small amount of money. I was nervous to put it in and try something. But I did it anyway. In my mind, I said, “I’m fully prepared to lose all this $2202. No worries.” But then, I didn’t lose it. I actually made money. </p><p>Later, I’ll show you how I start buying more stocks and higher priced stocks because of how my income goes up. </p><p>What do you think? Do you like seeing these posts?
