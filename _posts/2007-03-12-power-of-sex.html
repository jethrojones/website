Don't get me wrong, we already watched Jason and the Argonauts. During the whole movie, some of my students are talking. At any point during the movie, there is at least one student talking, not paying attention. However, there is a part where Meg sings about how she isn't really in love with Hercules. That was the only part in the whole movie where everyone was focused on the movie. Nobody said a word once she started singing. It was really interesting to watch how they were all mesmerized. They focused on her and the singing, and when it was over, they were able to talk again. I would say that it is the power of Music, and not sex, but during the other songs, they were not as interested in the movie. These 7th and 9th graders are experiencing "love" for the first time and I really believe that these segments in movies appeal to them.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">Image source: http://lnx.ginevra2000.it/Disney/megara1/meg4.jpg</span></span>
