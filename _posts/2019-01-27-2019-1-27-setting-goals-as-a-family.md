Each week, my family sets goals. This year, we started setting monthly and yearly goals.

This process takes about 5 minutes each week, and about 10 minutes the first week of a month.

It's really powerful, and helps us know what each person is working on throughout the year.

We set a family goal each month, as well.

Here's a picture of it of the tracking sheet.
