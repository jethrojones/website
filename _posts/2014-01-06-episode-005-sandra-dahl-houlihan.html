She has received numerous awards in her 7 years as an administrator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Leader of the Year&nbsp;</li>
<li>Rookie of the Year&nbsp;</li>
<li>Distinguished Principal of the Year&nbsp;</li>
<li>CITES Recognition&nbsp;</li>
<li>National Board Certified Teacher</li>
</ul>
<p>And, she is pretty much always being praised and recognized by her peers. I am fortunate to be able to work with her.</p>

<p>Big Goals: Wants to make people feel like they are at home-that her school is a family. Wants to be with the children as much as possible. Wants to provide a holistic education, especially to her disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>It is interesting to hear that she strives to really know her students, but is ok with not knowing every student&rsquo;s name. I find this fascinating. In the last episode, Dr. Villar was very focused on knowing every student&rsquo;s name. I don&rsquo;t know that either way is the best method, but I do believe that their intent is the same. They both want their students to know that they are cared for and feel safe. That is what matters.</p><br /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/2611540">Check out this episode!</a></p>
