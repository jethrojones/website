Hi Team,

Happy Monday, and I hope that everyone had a wonderful weekend in the snow! We went sledding and the kids played for hours outside. It was a lot of fun.

**Tutorials**

With the new mindfulness detention for tardies, we have a need to clarify sizes for tutorial choices. 
[Here is the FAQ](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/665822/FAQs.docx) again, and the part that has been updated:

*What is the minimum number of seats I can request for my tutorial?
Intervention tutorials need to 
**offer**
 at least 15 seats. Enrichment tutorials need to offer at least 25 seats. Tutorials offering less than these seats need to be approved by administration. This makes the flow of signing up 461 students at KMS much easier!

The reality is that if every teacher is doing a tutorial, we only need 17 seats in teacher’s class. When we offer tutorials that have more than 17 seats, like a basketball tutorial that has 40 seats, it relieves pressure on everyone else.

Here are some ideas for tutorials to offer.

**Upcoming Calendar items:**

**Resources:**

Here is a post from KQED’s Mind/Shift about 
[mindful pauses that can help student engagement](https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/02/17/slowing-down-to-learn-mindful-pauses-that-can-help-student-engagement/).

In Australia, they just started a new school year, because their school years go based on the calendar year. Here are 
[10 things you should know before your first day of school](http://www.evidencebasedteaching.org.au/10-things-every-teacher-know-starting-first-day-classroom/), and it is a helpful reminder in the middle of the year, too.

Thanks,

Jethro

P.S. Just a reminder that I will be out Thursday and Friday as I am attending the RTI conference in Anchorage.
