Dr. Spike Cook:


>It reminds me of the article that was published a few years ago titled, “Bubble wrap Generation.” In the article, the author discusses how we have created a group of kids who are put in a “bubble wrap” like existence where they don’t walk anywhere, climb things or take risks that were common place just a few decades ago.



My wife is the queen of caution. She always is sure that something bad is going to happen. I on the other hand encourage our kids to walk across log bridges on hikes and run through the forest (the bears will be more scared of them).
