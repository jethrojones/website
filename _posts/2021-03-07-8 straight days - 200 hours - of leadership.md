In a few weeks, the 400th episode of [Transformative Principal](https://jethrojones.com/podcast) will be released. 

With all the bonuses and extra episodes, the episode count is actually around 525! 

I did a little math today and saw that I’ve actually broken the 200 hour mark with today’s episode. 

That’s over 8 straight days of audio. 

As my cousin Joel said, “That’s a lot of talking and editing.”

It truly is. A lot. 

And, I love doing it. I have learned so much from this podcast. 

Had I been enrolled in a university program, I could have completed at least one PhD. 

I certainly have the knowledge and learning and research to have a PhD. 

Is there a university out there that would want to work with me on turning all this research into something?
