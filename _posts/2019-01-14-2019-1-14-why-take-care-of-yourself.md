Don’t “take care of yourself so you can help others” Take care of yourself because you are a human being, and that is what responsible and capable human beings do!

I wrote this as I was planning 
[my webinar on trauma-informed practices](https://jethro.webinarninja.com/webinar/78114) this morning.

All too often, in trainings and other places, we (educators) have heard that we need to take care of ourselves so we can take care of others. That's misguided. We need to take care of ourselves because we are human beings, and all humans deserve to be taken care of.
