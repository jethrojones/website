The 
[Oxford Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/propaganda) defines propaganda as "Information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view."

Propaganda has a negative connotation, especially in that definition above.

The reality for educators is that we are part of the state propaganda machine. We are a state controlled, required education system. What we are asked to teach has a biased perspective and we promote a particular political point of view.

We can see that as a bad thing, or we can see it as a sacred trust.

The question is, "What is the bias my kids are going to see in their school today?"

Or, are you going to teach kids that the grade is all that matters? Are you going to teach kids that compliance is the number 1 goal?

Are you going to teach kids to care about others? Are you going to teach kids to be selfless? Are you going to teach kids to be better than the previous generations? Are you going to teach kids to do their best work because they want to do their best work?

Will your propaganda with kids today have a negative or a positive bias?
