<p>I was super excited to interview Chris Wejr. He is one of those principals that I have been following for a long time and his take on discipline and behavior is inspiring.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving from a lower SES school to a higher SES school.</li>
<li>If kids are driven by rewards, then they are across all areas.</li>
<li>It is very easy to go too far with rewards, and focus only on providing rewards for kids to &ldquo;get us through the day.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The problem with determining how to properly implement PBIS.</li>
<li>The complexities of correcting a student&rsquo;s behavior by giving them a reward when they behave correctly.</li>
<li>How important it is to have sense of belonging to help students avoid negative behaviors.</li>
<li>Strategies to help students who struggle with negative behavior overcome those struggles.</li>
<li>It sometimes takes 2 years to get kids to overcome their struggles.</li>
<li>How to buy yourself some time to make decisions and help get through the day to make sure you help kids who are struggling.</li>
<li>The bouncy ball trick that worked for me every time after I interviewed him.</li>
<li>The difference between a program and a system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great interview. Chris is amazing!</p><br /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://transformativeprincipal.libsyn.com/positive-behavior-with-chris-wejr-transformative-principal-021">New Episode of @TrnFrmPrincipal</a></p>
