Dan Kerr


>Well, the answers have ranged from conservative, to reserved, to traditional, to idealistic, and all the way up to mind blowing and to truly visionary. In many cases however, a drop of cynicism arrives at the end and the answers get qualified with, “but we’re being held back by the traditional entrance requirements and structures of the world’s universities, and until those change, we’re prohibited from really bringing these visions to life”. Well, I’ve been hearing that for a number of years now, and I know there’s some real truth to that I guess, so here’s my idea…let’s start our own university and stop waiting for something that is in many ways out of our control. Bear with me, open up your mind, and take a second to dream…here’s the idea…



It may seem like a good idea to start a new university with the hope that we can enact systemic change, but I believe this is also the wrong way to go about it.


If we want things to change, it will require teamwork-a coordinated effort of many people willing to get together and make sure that we can do innovative things at the high school level coupled with a university that will be willing to ask the questions that Kerr is suggesting. Even without a particular university's support, we should still do these things, regardless of "support". We need courageous leaders to take a chance and go out on a limb.


This is scary, because the idea of going to college as the only option is so engrained in our culture. I believe it can happen, but it will be difficult to convince people to take a chance.
