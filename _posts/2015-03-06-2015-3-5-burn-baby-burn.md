Brad Gustafson:


>The thing I probably love most about “Soul on Fire” is that it requires a response.  It’s impossible not to feel anything after listening.  It’s impossible not to burn.  So what do you burn for?  What drives you?  Who and what define your classroom, school, and work?



Brad really is inspiring. I just get so jazzed learning from him. Amazing.
