So, my kids got a lot of Halloween candy. Each year, my wife does a great job of rationing out the candy for the kids. This year, I thought about developing habits, and wondered, "Which is better, binging and eating all the candy in one or two days, or saving the candy up and eating a piece every day for three weeks, thus creating a sweet tooth craving, or a habit of eating candy?"


What do you think?
