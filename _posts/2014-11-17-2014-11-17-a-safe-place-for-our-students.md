Chris Lehman:


>I worry that in many schools, there are not systems in place to recognize the challenges of trauma and stress outside of school place on our students. I worry that many schools don’t have the systems in place to a) learn when students are struggling with issues of hunger, homelessness, divorce, abuse to name a few, b) appropriately communicate issues to teachers, and c) create policy that creates school as safety net, rather than being another stress point in a child’s life.



Coincides nicely with that post about 
["THAT" kid](http://www.jethrojones.com/blog/2014/11/16/about-that-kid) the other day.
