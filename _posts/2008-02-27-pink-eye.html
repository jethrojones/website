I have pink eye. And yes, it sucks.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnMSFMZXEit7ZvwYj52ZYVptjKCq_o7m434ZMX33C7CzXyIPOAjScciqQdKHoh_KC5KCguZb2u3Cxxd4EEnxZZfRRKmoFWJoA1RlwWiyhIWNQ4Zn7mQkzYig_PSJPpL_F3kiloMQeUp3iQ/s1600-h/Picture+1.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnMSFMZXEit7ZvwYj52ZYVptjKCq_o7m434ZMX33C7CzXyIPOAjScciqQdKHoh_KC5KCguZb2u3Cxxd4EEnxZZfRRKmoFWJoA1RlwWiyhIWNQ4Zn7mQkzYig_PSJPpL_F3kiloMQeUp3iQ/s400/Picture+1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171815687885679506" border="0" /></a><br />The other thing that sucks is that tonight is parent teacher conferences, or as we say in our school, student-led conferences. The students come in and present information from each of their classes to their parents, and instead of all the the teachers sitting in the gym and getting monstrous headaches, the students come to our rooms and talk about things that are going on in their classes. It is a much better setup. I like these conferences a lot. I really like being there and talking to the parents. Since I have pink eye, and my wife and kids are all sick as well, I decided that I should come home and help them. When everyone is sick, just being there is a lot of help. So, I decided that I would set my school laptop up in my room and be home with my family. I am doing it through <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>. Below is a picture of what it looks like while I am waiting for people to come talk to me.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimOvNL8nwBtlJl_HxqWX5-Ko0n6jLYSeFc02CdZLFpD7CNfVy82ngoc7BzV0Lf12fr-_3ulYCzg8fHnTiu2XuoB1EDmMD7b1eJNt3WZiiXpyb3SM7gJHkHJK4Pl6LmAy90zXUrxg9A4V-F/s1600-h/Picture+2.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimOvNL8nwBtlJl_HxqWX5-Ko0n6jLYSeFc02CdZLFpD7CNfVy82ngoc7BzV0Lf12fr-_3ulYCzg8fHnTiu2XuoB1EDmMD7b1eJNt3WZiiXpyb3SM7gJHkHJK4Pl6LmAy90zXUrxg9A4V-F/s400/Picture+2.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171815889749142434" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I must admit that it is awesome to be able to do this. So cool.<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
