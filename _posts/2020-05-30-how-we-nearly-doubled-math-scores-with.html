His students recently showed a 77% growth in Math, and we talk about how he made that happen.</p> <ul> <li>Prairie hill is the school and the community comes together around it.</li> <li>Northern Illinois, PK–4th grade.</li> <li>9 years as the principal.</li> <li>Mission statement: Students first, always.</li> <li>PLC school</li> <li>Reformed schedule so that every day (4 teachers per team) have an hour of common collaborative time every day.</li> <li>Why are we making this decision? The students are always the bringback.</li> <li>Norms: imagine the students you are talking about are here.</li> <li>To be a great principal is easy. You just have to have a great staff.</li> <li>PE teacher said, “I want students more.”</li> <li>Each class has 10 half hour blocks each week: Art, PE, STEM,</li> <li>Always been a high performing district. Makes change really hard when you have had success in the past.</li> <li>staff is competitive within themselves.</li> <li>Noticed that math scores were less than we expected.</li> <li>Dove into the data.</li> <li>Computation was awesome, but they struggled with elaborating on their thoughts.</li> <li>In every math assignment, adding the words, “I know this because…”</li> <li>If you see something that can be done in Kindergarten it can be done anywhere.</li> <li>Ready Math - iReady as platforms for learning.</li> <li>Standards based School, done in isolation.</li> <li>Common language in math.</li> <li>Didn’t get good training at first, but then got good training and that made a huge difference.</li> <li>Math has always dealt black and white.</li> <li>Math didn’t have to be one answer, it could be a discussion, totally changed everything.</li> <li>Talking about kids’ growth, talking about assessments, classwork, and then looking at the data.</li> <li>It’s not about what you teach, it’s about what we learned.</li> <li>How long did it take to understand that it was working?</li> <li>It fit us, rather than us fitting it.</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal? Spend a little time with kids, like on their birthday. It’s a constant reminder that kids come first.</li> </ul> <p>Today’s Transformative Principal sponsor, <a href= "https://us.johncattbookshop.com/">John Catt Educational</a>, has been publishing high quality guidebooks, magazines and educator-focused professional development books since 1959.
