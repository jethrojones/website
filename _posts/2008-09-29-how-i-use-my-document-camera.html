Here is why:<br /><ol><li>It is easy to use</li><li>Everyone can use it at the same time (by looking at it, not directly touching/using it)</li><li>It allows me to model</li><li>I can record videos</li><li>I can take pictures of what the camera is seeing</li><li>The students know exactly what they need to write down at each stage of an assignment</li><li>Students (in Language Arts class) can receive immediate feedback from all students on their work</li><li>It is easier for students to keep up and stay engaged in the lesson<br /></li></ol>If you go to my school <a href="http://jethrojones.com/fhms/swat/Strategies.html">website</a>, you can see some videos that I have made of reading strategies. They are pretty boring to watch, but my kids love it when I am doing it live.<br /><br />I did a small, very unscientific test, to see how well using this worked. In one class, I just gave instructions on an assignment with the document camera, and the students understood, had fewer questions, and paid attention for the entire time. With the other class, I delivered the same instruction, but didn't turn on the document camera. That class was more distracted, had more questions, and did the assignment at a lower quality.<br /><br />The document camera is a simple thing, but it makes a big difference in student understanding.<br /><br />Anybody else use a document camera? How do you use it? How can I use mine better?<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
