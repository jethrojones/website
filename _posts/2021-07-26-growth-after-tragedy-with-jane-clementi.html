She left her church home of many years because she felt that while sitting in the pews of a church that condemned LGBT people she was herself a bystander to bullying. Jane leads an inspirational life through her unique experience which she shares with other parents, and speaks passionately about the need to divorce the concept of “sin” from homosexuality. She has made difficult choices in an impossible situation, and leads by example.<br /> She has spoken out in support of LGBT rights and the need for families and communities to embrace their LGBT populations. Jane has spoken before the U.S. Congressional HELP Committee, the National Cathedral, and numerous other faith communities, colleges, universities, high schools, and work places.</p> <br /><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/cybertraps/Jane_Clemente.mp3?dest-id=2561582">Check out this episode!</a></p>
