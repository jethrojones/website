<div class='posterous_autopost'>Among the many projects I completed around the house this summer, the "picpic" table (as Cali calls it) is one of my favorites. Just in time for the weather to turn to poor, I finally got it put together. Hopefully, we can have a few dinners outside and enjoy it before winter. I had to buy one new board and new bolts and screws. I painted the legs white with spray paint that was left here. I used our leftover green paint from our doors for the table and benches.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'> <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/EhJ3beD4jFyU4Kf7OoxxQ2AEhiahCPvmIbGAxxl0osDREI1zlHjAOvUwUJmp/photo_1.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Photo_1" height="373" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/DCBDTIthKDCu2aCXgY9cQKD4Ljmqu5rqGv6pFcZE1aOUdPvKKs2ujCA3dJ8h/photo_1.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a> </div> </p><p>The original table was left here by the previous owners and was in a sad state.</p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'> <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/qpb9yQzDTGhmrbg3LbIS1sYSEZ0dQEr1vg36t2fkZ6TjFYff6iVLLxLLPd5c/photo_2.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Photo_2" height="373" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/P0u6F3CCE5WjlVtYuNspmXZqkJeziX2BDBkUbbZFOIHAnnFL6lmAwumukUeG/photo_2.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a> </div> </p><p>Yeah, that's homemade ice cream the kids are eating.
