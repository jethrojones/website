<p>A few weeks ago I had the great pleasure of interviewing Tony Sinanis. Little did I know, that he would be named the <a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/jericho-educator-tony-sinanis-named-state-elementary-school-principal-of-the-year-1.7455369">New York Elementary Principal of the Year</a>! So, I interviewed him before he was famous. Tony <a href="http://twitter.com/tonysinanis">Twitter</a> is a great principal and one who is eager to share what he is doing well. He is also incredibly humble and self-aware. I hope you enjoy his interview. I sure learned a lot from him. Here is his <a href="http://www.bamradionetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=104&amp;Itemid=277">BrandED podcast</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Tony discusses his background and how he is a first-generation college graduate, and not only that, he is working on his PhD and already has two Masters!</li>
<li>Tony still keeps in contact with his first year&rsquo;s class. Wow!</li>
<li>Moving into his first school. Tony&rsquo;s humility recognizing that he wasn&rsquo;t the right fit for the school.</li>
<li>Separating Tony the principal from Tony the Person.</li>
<li>Recognizing that his cultural perspectives that were wrong for his school.</li>
<li>The difference between white guilt and recognizing differences.</li>
<li>Education is more than just the Common Core and High-Stakes Testing. We are disconnected from what the real world is.</li>
<li>We try to make kids fit into this little box, totally discongruent to how the world works.</li>
<li>He calls himself the Lead Learner, not the principal, because there is a real difference between the two.</li>
<li>How <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Cantiague&amp;src=hash">Cantiague</a> gives voice to the students.</li>
<li>He demonstrates his learning whenever he can. He pushes himself out of his comfort zone as often as he can.</li>
