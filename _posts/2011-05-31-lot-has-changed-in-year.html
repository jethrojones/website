<div class='posterous_autopost'>Last year, May 2010, I walked during lunch at work and rode my bike after work, some days. I also weighed about 250 pounds. In 2010, I rode 700 miles on my bike and I was pretty proud of myself. I rode 300 miles in 2009. <p /> So far this year, I have ridden over 400 miles; close to halfway to my goal of 1000 miles this year. I am down to 215 pounds now, and I feel great. <p />This has been a good year. <br /> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'> <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/NFRFLGKdLcDtzTaFJ2dqwqYdfCd43hYRSukK2wa6BKJm0uPuK6QYKaYeOEug/may2010.png"><img alt="May2010" height="674" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/JrxZM5ICJeHNlZqt15UirTm7apOM6LotBWY9PpLp3JqYTQhV22Yuv1zLRTs5/may2010.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a> <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/WrAKKvm1QwNmIbl3mTrqJWIafM5E3Hs8VXwKuIg2wvD0X0PRPr6uCoi81y78/may2011.png"><img alt="May2011" height="606" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/vIX5m07s1oL3AwhZKFE3VLZBAPnfPkzlj0qYN8h04CRunenqJOhW4OWV62i1/may2011.png.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" /></a> <div class='p_see_full_gallery'><a href="http://jethrojones.posterous.com/a-lot-has-changed-in-a-year">See the full gallery on Posterous</a></div> </div> </p></div>
