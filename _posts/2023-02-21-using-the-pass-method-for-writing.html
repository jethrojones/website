In this blog post, we'll show you how to interact with an AI tool using the PASS Method.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What do you want it to create? The first step in using an AI tool is to decide what you want it to create. Do you want it to summarize an article, generate questions, or create a lesson plan? Defining your prompt will help you narrow down your options and find an AI tool that meets your needs. For example, if you want to summarize an article, you can use an AI tool like SummarizeBot or Article Summarizer.</p><p><strong>Audience:</strong> Who is this for? The next step is to consider your audience. Who are you creating this for, and what do they need? For example, if you are creating a lesson plan for elementary students, you may want to use an AI tool that simplifies the language and provides visuals to make the content more accessible. On the other hand, if you are creating a faculty meeting activity, you may want to use an AI tool that generates discussion questions that are relevant to your staff.</p><p><strong>Specific Instructions:</strong> What are the things that must be done? Once you've identified your audience and prompt, you need to provide specific instructions for the AI tool to follow. </p><p>For example, if you are using an AI tool to generate questions, you may need to specify the topic, level of difficulty, and number of questions. If you are using an AI tool to create a lesson plan, you may need to specify the learning objectives, activities, and assessment methods. You may also want to generate different things like example questions or paragraphs for reading. </p><p><strong>Scope:</strong> How big is this project? Finally, you need to consider the scope of your project. Are you analyzing a YouTube video, a podcast, or an article? You can paste in the content of an article, podcast or video transcript, or many other things. </p><p>Using an AI tool can help you save time and create content that meets your audience's needs. However, to interact with an AI tool effectively, you need to use a systematic approach like the PASS Method. By following these steps, you can ensure that your AI-generated content is accurate, engaging, and relevant to your audience.</p>
