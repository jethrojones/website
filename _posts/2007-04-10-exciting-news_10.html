I am happy to say that I have started integrating technology into my classes more. I am starting with my Honors class because I can trust them a little more than my other classes right now. We have a <a href="http://partnerpage.google.com/jethrojones.com">start page</a> through Google that we use, and a class <a href="http://mrjonesenglish.21classes.com/">blog site</a>. This is exciting because I have wanted to get something like this going for quite some time, but never knew how to do it well. The host 21classes.com seems like a good fit since I can be the administrator of all the students' blogs and not worry about them wandering around in cyberspace.<br /><br />My one problem was that on every page I visited on the blog site, there was an ad that said, "Are you Gay? Take the quiz and find out!" I am pretty sure that I don't want to my students to be learning about their sexual orientation in my class. So, I had to buckle down and start paying for this service, but it is only $9 bucks a month, and the school is paying for it, so it is not that big a deal.<br /><br />The other interesting point about all this is that I finally found a use for my personal <a href="http://www.jethrojones.com">website</a>. I have to own a domain for the <a href="http://google.com/a">Google Apps</a> thing to work out. Since I have the domain name already, it is easy to incorporate that.
