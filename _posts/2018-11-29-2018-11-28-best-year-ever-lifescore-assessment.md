It’s that time of year again… time to set goals for 2019.

If you want to make 2019 a year of transformation, unlike any year before, you need to add intentionality into your planning.

If you're anything like me, you are constantly running from one thing to another, all the time! Sometimes it is hard to stop and think about what I really want to get better at.

Good news… there’s a free 
[assessment](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019assessment) for that.

Take the 
[LifeScore](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019assessment) assessment to discover your unique LifeScore.

Created by New York Times bestselling author Michael Hyatt, this assessment will help you identify your current condition in the 10 key domains of life: physical, spiritual, vocational, avocational, marital, social, parental, financial, intellectual, and emotional.

In just 5 minutes or less, you can understand how you can make 2019 your best year ever. Take this free assessment and share your results with your friends and family.

I took the assessment live on facebook, so you can watch it below if you want.

Take the 
[free assessment](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019assessment) here.

And, I would love for you to share your score with me! I'll be sharing mine with you tomorrow.

Enjoy!

The assessment (that Michael makes available for free) calculates everything for you. You just read the descriptions, pick the one that's most accurate for you, and then you'll have your overall score. It's fast and easy. But you'll come away with tremendous clarity when you're finished.
