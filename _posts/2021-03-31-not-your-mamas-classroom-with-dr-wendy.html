This is a simulcast with Dr. Oliver's <a href= "https://www.edisonlearning.com/podcast">Building the Bridge</a> podcast.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>&nbsp;Links <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3rVC6aG">Not Your Mama’s Classroom: What You Need to Know as a Parent About Your Child’s Digital Education</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Guest Bio <ul> <li>Dr. Wendy Oliver is a highly qualified Tennessee teacher and administrator who has pioneered digital learning across multiple states and school districts.

As more students of all ages are participating in online or hybrid schooling, how is exposure to online risks increasing?</strong></li> <li><strong>How do educators have the right conversations with parents and students around digital safety?</strong></li> <li><strong>K–12 education is trending toward digital and that’s not just going to stop. It’s not a system parents and students can just “opt out” of, but can they influence and change the system to work better? Particularly thinking about students’ rights, privacy and safety.</strong></li> <li><strong>Are there legal and ethical obligations coming into play for teachers when students go online, which they may not even be aware of? What are they?</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Thanks to our mission partner:</h2> <p><a href="https://buoyancydigital.com">Buoyancy Digital</a> is proud to be the inaugural Mission Partner for the Cybertraps Podcast series.
