[10 Month Adventure: White Space for "all" kids is not going to work](http://dougtimm.blogspot.com/2015/11/white-space-for-all-kids-is-not-going.html?m=1)


>“WE DO THIS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR KIDS.” That is always the argument, or is that just something you attach to an idea like a bumper sticker to a car to send a message.  I never use that term.  Because quite frankly at this point, if I am not assuming my decisions are what is best for kids and I have to utter those words, then I am trying to convince myself and therefore had doubt to begin.  



Doug is totally on the money here. Every time I hear someone say that, I ask myself, "Who is this person trying to convince?"
