Having been a successful teacher, principal, central office administrator, professional developer and consultant in a variety of school districts, he brings his passion, expertise, and skills to his writing and speaking as he engages participants in meaningful and practical learning. In his new book, Let’s Put the C in PLC: A Practical Guide for School Leaders, Chad offers readers and audiences educational research, engaging stories, hands-on tools, and useful knowledge and skills they can implement immediately.<br /> The results of Chad’s work speak for themselves. One district was identified as “Persistently Lowest Achieving” upon his arrival, and within a few years — by applying the principles of his book — multiple schools were recognized as National PLC Models for improving student learning. Chad has served on and led accreditation visits for Cognia around the United States and world, presented nationally and internationally, collaborated with school boards, intermediate service agencies, state departments of education, and professional associations, and trained as an agency trainer for Adaptive Schools.</p> <ul> <li>What is a PLC and how do we know if we are in a PLC?</li> <li>Where we are all taking collective responsibility for student learning.</li> <li>PLC is not a time.</li> <li>PLC is a community.</li> <li>10 Elements of principal knowledge.  * Why is it important for school leaders to create a collaborative environment for their staff? * What are some of the biggest challenges to creating this culture?
