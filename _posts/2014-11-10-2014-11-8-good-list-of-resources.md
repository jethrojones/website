From Dan Meyer:


>Kyle Pearce 
[created the most interesting iBook](http://tapintoteenminds.com/2014/09/20/free-pythagorean-theorem-ibook/) I have ever seen for math class. It overclocks all the built-in features (video embeds, etc.) and then goes over the top, including collaborative student data displays. Awesome. Not easy.
