His teaching experience includes physical education, Spanish, first through fourth grades, and middle school language arts. His leadership philosophy is embodied in the phrase, “Educational Leadership through Partnership.“ Dr. Wheeler believes that two elements define 21st century schools: relationships and ”edgework."</p> <p>Dr. Wheeler is a former member of the Board of Governors for the Northwest Association of Independent Schools (NWAIS) and founding member of the Rubicon Educational Foundation Board of Directors. He currently serves on the Accreditation Committee for NWAIS and the CustomED Board of Directors.

He is proud to have the opportunity to collaborate with an exceptional leadership and teaching team at STS, which has resulted in the School being recognized as being one of 33 Microsoft Showcase Schools worldwide, LEED Gold certification, and WA Green School status.</p> <ul> <li>St. Thomas School founded in 1951, preschool through 8th grade</li> <li>How to have spiritual growth even though they are not affiliated to a church anymore.</li> <li>Our role is to affirm families’ values and beliefs.</li> <li><a href= "https://www.stthomasschool.org/hallmarks/edgework">Edge work</a></li> <li>Comfort Zone</li> <li>Growth Zone</li> <li>Edge is between comfort and growth zone</li> <li>Professional experiences related to edge work.</li> <li>Pandemic has really helped us all experience</li> <li>Need others, need relationships.</li> <li>Celebrate corporations that fail fast and fail forward.</li> <li>We want kids to take risks, but we forget they are watching us.</li> <li>Being vulnerable and transparent about the fear that I’m experiencing</li> <li>How to implement edge work in your school?</li> <li>Structures that reward risk taking.</li> <li>Look for alignment in what you’re. assessments look like and what you want kids to learn.</li> <li>Naming it and calling it out.</li> <li>Give students leadership opportunities.</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal? 5 year journal.</li> <li>5 lines to reflect on your day - year over year</li> </ul> <h2>Sponsors</h2> <h3>InControl SEL for Middle School</h3> <p>In Control created an effortless social and emotional, character development video curriculum for your students that’s ZERO-TEACHER-PREP AND it’s so cool looking- it feels like a Youtube or Netflix Series- and that’s purposeful, they meet students right where they’re at.</p> <p>The videos are 5-6 minutes, kids love them, teachers love them, and you will too.
