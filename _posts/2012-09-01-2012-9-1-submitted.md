The Paperless Principal Book has just been 
submitted to published by Apple. In celebration of 
the waiting period being able to buy it 
[here](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/paperless-principal/id558201943?ls=1), I am giving away the following iOS apps that I talk about in the book:



​
[TextExpander Touch​](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander/id326180690?mt=8)- Use your TextExpander library of snippets on your iOS device. 

[PDFPen for iPad​](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen/id490774625?mt=8)- PDF reader extraordinaire for your iPad.

[JotNot Scanner Pro​](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jotnot-scanner-pro/id307868751?mt=8)- Scanning software for your iOS devices (Universal).

[Scanner Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8) - Scanning software for your iOS devices (Universal).

All you have to do is like the 
[facebook](http://facebook.com/paperlessprincipal) page, or tweet using the hashtag #paperlessprincipal. ​Each method counts as one entry.

​Each method is counted as an entry, and I will randomly choose a winner on September 5, at 9:00 pm MST, and another winner on Friday, September 7 at 6 pm MST. And then more winners to be announced the following week.

​The developers of these apps are not connected to this giveaway. I will simply be gifting apps to the winners.
