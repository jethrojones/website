Can you believe it? Today is the last day of the Transformative Leadership Summit!

I hope that you have been inspired and uplifted by this Summit. I know I have. There have been so many people who have reached out on twitter to thank me. It has been amazing. I know this is truly impacting your life, and that means the world to me.

I’m all about improving. Could you give me some 
[feedback here, please?](https://goo.gl/forms/hdgIlPO97RHT5FQk2)

I want next year’s Transformative Leadership Summit to be even better. 
[Please help me](https://goo.gl/forms/hdgIlPO97RHT5FQk2).

Let’s get to 
[today’s videos](http://transformativeleadershipsummit.com/sessions-2017/parentcommunity-experience/day-8/)!

[William Parker](http://transformativeleadershipsummit.com/team/william-d-parker/), who rocked last year’s Summit with KRAs comes back this year with Messaging  Matters. It really does. He talks about how to communicate the good story that is your school without letting someone else control the narrative. Even though I am not good at doing this, I am going to start a week-in-review email for my staff, parents, community, news outlets, and more so that they can have the story of my school as I want it told.

Yesterday, we learned from Katie Kinnaman about the importance of communicating and working with highly involved parents, and today, we are going to learn from 
[Dr. Kashi Bazemore-Hall](http://transformativeleadershipsummit.com/team/dr-kashi-bazemore-hall/) about her school in rural North Carolina and how she got parents involved, who would have never thought of sending their kids to a school in the white neighborhood. Really powerful stories from her.

Finally, 
[Shane Safir](http://transformativeleadershipsummit.com/team/shane-safir/) will talk about the importance of doing community walks with your staff about your students. I really like her approach, and she really inspires you to get out and get to know your community. Last Saturday, I went to a community event about going back to school, and I saw a lot of people from different schools and it was a really great experience. We need to do more to make sure that we are truly connecting with our students, their families, and the culture they bring to our school which “enriches” our schools.
