I'm no doctor, but life experience has taught me this much, at least:<br /><br />1. Spend the night outside when it is cold.<br />2. Make sure it is rainy, too.<br />3. Sleep poorly.<br />4. Get in line with 44,999 of your closest friends (many of whom also spent the night outside).<br />5. Huddle in a small enclosed space with live flu strains floating around.<br /><br />"People started arriving as early as Friday night to get into line -- bringing food, blankets and umbrellas. Some arrived around 6 a.m. -- an hour before the clinics opened -- only to learn they were too late."<br /><br />Story from KSL: <a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=8430943">http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=8430943</a>
