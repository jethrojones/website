Yesterday, a pipe burst in my school and flooded a whole wing.

In no time, the district "red shirts" were there to fix it and clean up. Shortly afterward, the "green shirts" (custodians) swooped in and helped clean up to.

I was notified at 7:48.

School started with flooded classrooms cleaned up on time at 9:30. Amazing response from our support staff.

We rerouted drop-off for parents and buses.

That was all good and wonderful.

But the thing that brought tears to my eyes was a sweet student and her mom swinging close to me in their car when I was directing traffic in the cold to give me a little blueberry muffin.

Everyone wants to be seen. Even adults.
