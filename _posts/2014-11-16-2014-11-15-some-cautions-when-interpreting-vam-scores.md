Principal J. Robinson:


>Today, I spent a little time looking over the 
[American Statistical Association’s](http://www.amstat.org/policy/pdfs/ASA_VAM_Statement.pdf) "ASA Statement on Using Value-Added Models for Educational Assessment.” That statement serves as a reminder to school leaders regarding what these models can and cannot do. Here, in North Carolina and in other states, as school leaders begin looking at  No Child Left Behind Waiver-imposed value added rankings on teachers, they would do well to remind themselves of the cautions describe by ASA last April.



I'm so grateful to be in Alaska where we are using Student Learning Objectives for the Student Learning Data component of ESEA waiver requirements. It at least allows teachers to have some control, and truly can impact quality teaching and learning.
