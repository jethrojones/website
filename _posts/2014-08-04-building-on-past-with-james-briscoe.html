<ul>
<li>The strengths of Canyons school district.</li>
<li>The importance of the involvement of families.</li>
<li>We should try to do what we are doing even better. Teacher and principal input needs to be truly valued.</li>
<li>Making sure everyone in the organization feels valued.</li>
<li>Honoring the past before you build for the future.</li>
<li>Principal qualities Dr. Briscoe is looking for: having a vision compared to implementing a vision. Humility. Accessible and visible. Patience. Admit mistakes. Regardless of the other person&rsquo;s opinion, you need to respect the person and take their opinion or concern seriously.</li>
<li>Focus on the vision and goal of your school, just take the time to meet with people and explain your rationale.</li>
<li>Most of the time, if you explain what you&rsquo;re thinking, the people who disagree are OK with your decision, even if they don&rsquo;t agree with it.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t ask people for their input if you have already made your decision.</li>
<li>How to deal with taking the hits: exercise, without your health, you can&rsquo;t do anything.</li>
<li>The importance of being recognizable. Walk up and introduce yourself to people out and about, and ask them if they have school-age kids.</li>
<li>A school leader is a leader in the community. You must get out and meet with local clubs and groups.</li>
<li>The benefit of being from a small district and being involved in every department in the district.</li>
<li>How to be a transformative principal: Take a risk!</li>
<li>What is in his office to keep him motivated? A poster that says, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t climb the mountain, you can&rsquo;t enjoy the view.&rdquo;</li>
