Not everybody has good reliable internet at home, and sometimes Zoom Meetings don’t work especially well.

In order for this to work, someone needs the mobile app. Follow the highlighted screenshots below to make it work.

Tap settings on the bottom, then tap meetings.

Tap “Auto Connect to Audio” which by default is off.

Then choose, “Call my Phone Number” and they can be called when joining a meeting, then once they get the phone call, they will be able to hang up the zoom call in the app.

They can put their local number in under phone number and save it there. Then, every time they join a meeting, they can make it work. 

























Keep in mind that if the host has not enabled call outs (which may cost more) this might not work. So, it likely won’t work for free educator plans.

























And that is my real number: +1 (801) 252-6368 you can text me or
