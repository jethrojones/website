Joe Bower:


>Poor PedagogyÂ + Technology = Accelerated Malpractice



This can be said about any technology we use in education.


Joe then goes on to describe 6 very good reasons why we should be wary of Class Dojo. As a young teacher, I was very excited about Class Dojo. As I have seen how ineffective that tool is at motivating real change,  I have learned that relationships are a much more powerful way to enact change. It takes longer, but also works longer.
