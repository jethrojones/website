<span style="font-style: italic;">I am following the lead of an </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://deeperwater.com/2007/11/04/a-teaching-meme/">edublogger</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> that I just learned about. I don't know any of the teachers' blogs that I read, and I only know one of the bloggers that is a teacher. </span><br /><br /><p><strong>1. I am a good teacher because…</strong> I love learning and helping other people learn.<br /></p> <p><strong>2. If I weren’t a teacher, I would be…</strong> lost! All through my life I have wanted to be a teacher. I tried to avoid it, but I knew I would end up in education. I believe any job in education is there to help students learn.<br /></p> <p><strong>3. My teaching style is…</strong> dependent on my students, but sadly probably more authoritative than I would like.<br /></p> <p><strong>4. My classroom is…</strong> covered in paper. I have papers all over my desk and counter top. My organization skills are in desperate need of assistance from a professional organizer.<br /></p> <p><strong>5. My lesson plans…</strong> are <a href="http://jethrojones.com/fhms/planbook/Language%20Arts%207/index.html">online.</a><br /></p> <p><strong>6. One of my teaching goals is…</strong> to start my own school (that goal is still many years away from being accomplished.)<br /></p> <p><strong>7. The toughest part of teaching is…</strong> motivating the unmotivated, (I agree with Blair).<br /></p> <p><strong>8. The thing I love most about teaching is…</strong> when students "get it". The "Oh, I get it now!" is the best and most exciting thing to hear.<br /></p> <p><strong>9. A common misconception about teaching is…</strong> those who can't do, teach. (And by extension, those who can't teach, teach PE.)<br /></p> <p><strong>10. The most important thing I’ve learned since I started teaching…</strong> It takes time to be a good teacher. Teaching is a marathon, not a sprint.<br /></p>
