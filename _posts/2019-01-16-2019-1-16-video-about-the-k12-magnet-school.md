I presented to the school board for the K12 magnet school I am working on.

The conversation was great, with really good questions from the board members and a request for more information from them, which is a positive next step.

It's still going to be a while before the doors open, if they do, but positive direction is a good thing.

Here's a video that I showed them to give a high-level overview. It's two minutes long.


We are asking the school board to support further development of the K12 Magnet school.
