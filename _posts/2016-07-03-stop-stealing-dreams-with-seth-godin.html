How do you make failing safe?</p> <p>Can everyone succeed being independent?<br /> How can the little guy compete with someone like Walmart?</p> <p>How do you help teachers not want to be competent anymore?</p> <p>How do you measure the experience? How do you know if has been successful?</p> <p>If we give kids the ability to dream, they’ll figure out the grammar and history the minute it helps them reach their dreams.</p> <hr /> <p>Also, please be sure to sign up for the <a href= "https://gc319.isrefer.com/go/tls/jethrojones/podcast">Transformative Leadership Summit</a> to learn from some of the greatest minds in education today!</p> <hr /> <p>How to make a ruckus in a highly bureaucratic, slow moving monstrosity that is education.</p> <ul> <li>Has anyone done something that others were delighted by?</li> <li>We’ve all been impacted by teachers who made a difference.</li> <li>It is a mistake to first look at gravity if you are a beginning runner.</li> <li>Brooke Jackson the Lab School NY</li> <li>Show up with a different agenda</li> <li>Already voted</li> <li>If this were easy, everyone would be doing it.</li> <li>Afraid of being called out by our hubris, getting in trouble with the bureaucracy.</li> <li>Going outside the box</li> <li>When we get true enrollment from the students.</li> <li>10% where we can have non-factory time.</li> <li>What enrollment means.</li> <li>What did the student and parents sign up for?</li> <li>How to learn about Baseball</li> <li>The lesson plan</li> <li>What’s your attitude?</li> <li>Interesting is more important than right.</li> <li>Why memorize nothing?</li> <li>We don’t need people to memorize recipes.</li> <li>Sarah Kay poetry - no right answer for your poetry.</li> <li>Competence is overrated.</li> <li>Write books not read them.</li> <li>What if they don’t learn the grammar that way?
