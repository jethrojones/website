I am 2nd year teacher of 7th grade language arts in Utah. I also am enrolled in the Executive Leadership program offered through Brigham Young University. I see this blog as an opportunity and place where I can express my feelings and thoughts. It will allow me to reflect on the things that happen to me. It is a place where I can put my ideas where they will hopefully never go away. As I said in my very first post, I hope that it will be beneficial for me and at least one other person.<br /><br />Have a good life.
