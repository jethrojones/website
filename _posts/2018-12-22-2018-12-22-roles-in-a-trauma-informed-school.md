Trauma.

It happens.

Our kids are more exposed to it now than ever before.

We can either run from it, or we can deal with it head on.

I've created a resource to help you with it.

What's your role in a trauma-informed school? Are you a teacher? A counselor? A secretary? A principal? All of these roles impact a student.

And honestly, it takes everyone.

Here's the jpg version, or enter your email below and I'll send you a PDF of it, which is better for printing!
