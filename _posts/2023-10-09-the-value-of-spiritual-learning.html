It may be a rather unconventional juxtaposition, but like the nuanced intricacies of political debate, learning in its deepest form is deeply spiritual and transcendent.</p><p>Firstly, what does it mean that all learning is spiritual? Quite simply, It means that you learn it at such a depth that it is deeper than surface level knowledge and is part of your core being. It’s reminiscent of the adage that once you learn to ride a bike, you never forget, even if you have <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21455-amnesia">amnesia</a>, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Truly, riding a bike is not spiritual, but the learning of riding a bike is, because it sticks with you. Similarly, when our values cement themselves into our belief system to the point of unwavering conviction, we've embraced them at a spiritual level. We will most certainly forget this course, this assignment, that discussion but it's the spiritually deep lessons that become enduring facets of our consciousness.</p><p>But how does this connect with the notion of civility, especially outside the classroom? There is an unfortunate trend of ‘othering’ that's rampant, especially when hot-button issues arise. The current political atmosphere, dominated by the theatrics of "dunking on" adversaries, has unfortunately permeated classroom settings. This divisive approach is further exacerbated by belief attribution, where rhetorical strategies are weaponized to advance one's agenda, often by resorting to hyperbole and false equivalencies. Seen even in doctoral level classes, where a student equating the original salute to the flag of the United States with the Nazi salute. Such strategies, driven more by the desire to provoke than to engage in honest discourse, are detrimental to the very essence of education and discourse.</p><p>Thus arises the need for intellectually charitable routines and practices, reminding us of the virtues that should guide discourse. These ideas are collaborated with Dr. Shirzad Chamine’s 2012 book <a href="https://amzn.to/3tyRwXW">Positive Intelligence</a>(inviting us to enter the sage mind and have empathy with others) and Steve Young’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3RSbJCd">The Law of Love</a> (inviting us to see others as children of God and loving them first and foremost) suggest, fostering a genuine connection and sense of empathy towards our sparring partner can elevate the quality of our dialogue. While academic environments provide a structured setting for these discussions, with guidelines and, at times, the moderating presence of educators, the true test of these virtues is in fact beyond the classroom walls. It's in the unmoderated, real-world scenarios that students truly face the challenge of maintaining civility.</p><p>While fostering civility within the classroom is undoubtedly essential, its true measure is gauged by how it's practiced outside of it. Not only is it crucial to inculcate civility in students, but it's paramount for them to embody these virtues beyond academic confines. Like the spiritual lessons that stay with us, the ethos of civility, when deeply ingrained, can transform both the learner and society at large.</p><p>In fact, students’ spiritual learning of this ability is the only thing that matters.</p><p></p>
