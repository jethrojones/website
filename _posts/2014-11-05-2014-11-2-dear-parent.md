Tony Sinanis:


>You see, as a fellow educator, I am always hesitant to send you any notes or make contact via email or the phone because I don't want to be THAT parent; I don't want you to think I am trying to tell you how to do your job or that I think I know better; I don't want you to think I don't understand my son's areas of need and his strengths; I just don't want to be THAT parent but today I realized my own concerns or fears are impacting my ability to be an advocate for my son and I can't allow that anymore. So, that is why I am finally reaching out to you... not to complain; not to share my opinions about your work as an educator; not to be negative or critical. No, I am not doing any of those things - I am just sharing my hopes for my son as it relates to his educational experience.



Tony is so insightful. I learn something from him every time I read him.


Two points about this article: 
1. I feel the same way about contacting teachers of my kids. 
2. I feel the same way about all the kids I work with each day. I want them to be successful. I want them to be happy. I want them to know that we care about them.
