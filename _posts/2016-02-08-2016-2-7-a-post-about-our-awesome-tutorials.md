[My Favorite Tier 2 Intervention: Tutorial | ottographblog](https://ottographblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/08/my-favorite-tier-2-intervention-tutorial/)


>The first time I ran a math tutorial, I set a cap of 10, but only assigned 8 students. On the Monday that begins each tutorial cycle, teachers receive a roster.  To my surprise, all the slots were full.  That meant that two students had chosen to attend math tutorial with me.  I thought this was a fluke.  As an experiment, I left a few slots open for each cycle I taught. It turns out that every single cycle, students have signed themselves up by choice and filled my tutorial section.  Kids know what they need to be successful and want opportunities to improve.  In fact – I kid you not – there is a wait list for the next long division tutorial.
