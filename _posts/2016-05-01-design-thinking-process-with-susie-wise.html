Back again in 2012 she is leading our efforts to support the movement bringing design thinking into K12 teaching and learning. Susie stumbled upon design thinking when she took a course with David Kelley in 2003 and the experience helped her make sense of the universe. Susie is motivated by the simple belief that humans are by nature designers. Recently a design strategist and innovation coach at Intuit, her practice centers on inspiring teams to use empathy to get to innovative outcomes. Susie has a PhD in Learning Sciences and Technology Design from Stanford&rsquo;s School of Education and is a co-founder of Urban Montessori Charter School in Oakland. She lives there with her husband and daughter (yes, the one in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi867173401">Babies</a>).</p>

<li>New way to seek opportunities and problem solve.</li>
<li>Traditional Analytic ways of thinking: see a problem, come up with ideas, do a lot of planning</li>
<li>Empathize first, to see what they could see. Ask questions, immersion. Understand the space in a human centered way.</li>
<li>Define the problem once you have empathy.</li>
<li>Once you have framed what you&rsquo;re going after, ideate.</li>
<li>Ideation is about separating idea formation from selection. Yes and vs Yes but.</li>
<li>Prototype - make bite-sized change.</li>
<li>Test it out in small spaces to see if you are on the right track in a human-centered way.</li>
<li>Do it rapidly. How quickly could you prototype and test your ideas?</li>
<li>Mine the failures for learning.</li>
<li>Questions to ask after empathy experience: Ask Why 5 times.</li>
<li>It can be scary to ask Why.</li>
<li>It is about people.</li>
<li>Somebody pulls out or somebody pulls rank.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s run those prototypes.</li>
<li>Bias towards action.</li>
<li>Practice on hacking things that are not in school. Hack something in life.</li>
<li>Breaking it down into the smallest possible size to get quick wins.</li>
<li>Take on more complex tasks.</li>
<li>How to be a transformative principal? 1. Shadow a student and 2. put yourself in a different position than you have been in.</li>
