<p>I interviewed Doug because I read his book and was really fascinated by it. I have learned that not everyone teaches the same way (DUH!). But, also, our own life experiences have taught us and shaped us into the people we are today. To be a great teacher, you don&rsquo;t need to be like [Enter Great Teacher&rsquo;s Name]. Doug and every excellent &ldquo;popular&rdquo; or famous or movie teacher have two things in common:</p>
<ol>
<li>A strong desire to be your own person, regardless of the status quo or anybody else&rsquo;s judgments.</li>
<li>A passion to help kids learn.</li>
</ol>
<p>As part of this podcast, I want to start interviewing master teachers who are really great at what they do. I am especially interested in teachers that are great at making their kids enjoy class and learn life lessons, not just making sure they are acing the tests. ;)</p>
<p>Notes from my conversation with Doug:</p>
<ul>
<li>He used to teach in Hawaii, so we talked a little about that before the official interview started, but it was fascinating, so I included it.</li>
<li>Teaching is a performance art</li>
<li>Acting vs. Teaching.</li>
<li>Importance of trust in teaching.</li>
<li>What happens in my classroom happens because I want it to.</li>
<li>To Principals: You hired me to do my job, now let me do it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nerdist.com/author/chris-hardwick/">Chris Hardwick</a></li>
<li>How he takes away the opportunity to make excuses.</li>
<li>How swimming helped him learn to stop making excuses.</li>
<li>Why you can&rsquo;t keep complaining without doing something to fix it.</li>
<li>It is OK to vent about kids. &ldquo;But, my kids don&rsquo;t give me much to complain about.&rdquo; (That is because if they did, he would take responsibility for it!)</li>
<li>&ldquo;My classroom is noisy because it has to be noisy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;My students are weird, what am I doing to make them weird.&rdquo;</li>
<li>I give two cents on why I like a noisy cafeteria.</li>
<li>Some discussion on the term &ldquo;digital native&rdquo;.</li>
<li>We should call what we do &ldquo;Practicing Education&rdquo; just like lawyers practice law and doctors practice medicine.</li>
<li>How being a good teacher and establishing the basics allows us to know how we can change things up as we go along.</li>
<li>What kind of an environment does Doug need to thrive? Trust!</li>
<li>How trusting students is an extension of the trust from administration.</li>

<li>How to have your own style. Don&rsquo;t teach like someone else. Teach like yourself.</li>
<li>Some kids don&rsquo;t respond well to the style of Doug&rsquo;s teaching.</li>
