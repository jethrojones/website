<p>Mike is a principal of a pre-K&ndash;8 school. He is a great principal and also really great at using technology in unique ways. You can follow him on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/techedvance">@Techedvance</a>). Spending a few minutes on his <a href="http://www.techedvance.com">web site</a> will teach you a ton about how to use technology to improve your professional practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>How Mike got into administration.</li>
<li>The difference between public schools and private (religious) schools. Doing more with less. Relying on fundraising.</li>
<li>We need to strike the right balance between instructional leadership and all the other stuff we are tempted to spend our time on.</li>
<li>The most important aspects of Mike&rsquo;s leadership.</li>
<li>There is a little more flexibility in how things are done in the private school, and they are able to meet the needs differently.</li>
<li>How to challenge teachers to do better.</li>
<li>Hiring makes a huge difference.</li>
<li>We give teachers tools and an opportunity to learn on their own, share with their colleagues and grow.</li>
<li>What kind of people Mike is looking for as teachers: What is it about this age group of students that makes you want to teach them?</li>
