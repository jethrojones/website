So, another cool thing I found on the BzzAgent.com Frogpond is the New York Public Library website that has digital prints of thousands of pictures. This would be great for Matt! who is always looking for more stuff that has to do with Utah Studies. I didn't look through all of them, but there were 8 pages of images from searching Utah. Here are two that I got from there. Very cool. <a href="http://www.bzzagent.com//p/1054185414/arthurjmcdougal">Visit New York Public Library Digital Gallery.</a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?55069" title="Great Salt Lake, Utah.
