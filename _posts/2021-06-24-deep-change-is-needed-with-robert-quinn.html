Otherwise it is a slow death.</li> <li>“Knowledge is the ungrateful child of learning.”</li> <li>We go to great lengths to deny the need for change.</li> <li>Positive organization scholarship.</li> <li>The problem with thinking “I am powerless to try to change our system“</li> <li>We have evidence all around us that what we are thinking is wrong.</li> <li>If one teacher is doing it, that means it’s possible.</li> <li>The question is “What’s real?”</li> <li>The principal’s reference point is the middle of the curve.</li> <li>The way you change things is you begin to learn from excellence.</li> <li>We are looking for meaningful life, but something blocks us, that’s fear.</li> <li>Principals believe that their most valued contribution is to prevent conflict.</li> <li>Leadership is about creating conflict. Turn it into transformative cooperation.</li> <li>Realization of potential.</li> <li>Great teachers vs. good teachers.</li> <li>4 variables: idealized influence, individualized concern, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation (using inquiry to stimulate change)!</li> <li>Love of learning transcends other challenges.</li> <li>People not marching to the drum of convention.</li> <li>We are all subject to the slow death.</li> <li>What result do I want to create?</li> <li>You’ve linked your identity</li> <li>Create the future that doesn’t yet exist.</li> <li>Each failure is a step to find out your potential.</li> <li>Purpose driven Life.</li> <li>The moment you commit to a purpose, you moralized your life.</li> <li>When you find out who you are, you find your true character.</li> <li>Your best self begins to emerge.</li> <li>Fail, fail, fail, then succeed.</li> <li>You develop transformative power.</li> <li>If you want to be a really good teacher…</li> <li>No matter what they say or do, every student wants to learn, every students wants to succeed.</li> <li>When you break that code, everything changes.</li> <li>Animate a community - put together things they want, nurture them, and then you can take it to the next level.</li> <li><a href= "https://www.transformativeprincipal.org/standing-and-delivering-with-henry-gradillas-transformative-principal-special/"> Henry Gradillas</a></li> <li>How to be a transformative principal? Sit down, and ask, what result do I want to create? Why am I on the earth? What’s my purpose in life? When I die how will the planet be different because I’m here. Am I internally connected? Am I other focused? Am I externally open?</li> </ul> <h2>Sponsors</h2> <h3>InControl SEL for Middle School</h3> <p>In Control created an effortless social and emotional, character development video curriculum for your students that’s ZERO-TEACHER-PREP AND it’s so cool looking- it feels like a Youtube or Netflix Series- and that’s purposeful, they meet students right where they’re at.</p> <p>The videos are 5-6 minutes, kids love them, teachers love them, and you will too.
