<span style="display: inline;" id="vidDescRemain">This is a video that was created by <a href="http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/">Karl Fisch</a>, and modified by <a href="http://www.dangerouslyirrelevant.org/">Scott McLeod</a> (I am not sure if this is the correct link for Scott McLeod, and if it is not, I will quickly change it as soon as I know). Globalization and The Information Age is really what it is about. I don't know how many of these claims are true or correct, but that is not important. What I believe is important is the idea of what is behind this. The world changes fast. We need to be prepared for it and make sure that those over whom we have stewardship are well-prepared for it also. </span>     <object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ljbI-363A2Q"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ljbI-363A2Q" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></object></embed>
