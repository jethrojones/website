I have had a great 2018 so far. Life is wonderful. But it's not perfect.

I had a couple goals this year that I really didn't do well on, and abandoned part way through the year.

One goal was a fitness goal. I want to be in much better shape than I am now, but I just couldn't make it happen this year.

Now I know why.

I just watched 
[Michael Hyatt's Video:](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019videoseries) 3 Necessary Ingredients to make 2019 Your Best Year Ever.

It was really good. It showed me what I was lacking.

I thought that setting the goal was good enough. The ingredient that I was missing was a solid plan.

But, here's the thing, I knew I needed a plan, but I procrastinated making the plan. I didn't want to do it right away for some reason, I don't know why.

Then, I just kept putting it off.

I should have made the plan right away. I didn't. And so, eventually, it just got away from me and there was no way to get back on the horse.

There are two more ingredients in 
[Michael's video](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019videoseries). Go check those out and see what you need to do to make 2019 amazing.
