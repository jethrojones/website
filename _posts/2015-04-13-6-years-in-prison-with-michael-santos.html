He is a former convict who spent 26 years in prison for running drugs. He says he never touched the drugs, but organized other people to do it. Pretty amazing story.</p>
<p>Michael has a <a href="http://michaelsantos.com/podcast">podcast out</a>, now as well. He pipes it into the prison system to help people learn to change.<br /> You can learn a little bit more about Michael here:<br /> &bull; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/santos-former-prisoner-looks-help-others/">PBS NewsHour</a>&nbsp;(7-minute profile)<br /> &bull; <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/From-Scarface-To-SF-State-One-Teachers-Remarkable-Journey-228289111.html">NBC Bay Area Proud</a>&nbsp;(5-minute profile)<br /> &bull; <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Inmate-shares-prison-survival-strategies-4064484.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a>&nbsp;(Front-page profile)</p>
