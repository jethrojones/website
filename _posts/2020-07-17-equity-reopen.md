TLDR; Plans based on equity, what kids need. In person for those who must, virtual for those who can, self-directed for others.

In education, we often make the mistake of doing everything the same for everyone. We usually call that equity, but that is really equality.

Equity means that we give people what they need when they need it.

There’s a difference.

Here’s how I would propose our equity approach should work.

(To be fair, I don’t think every school is equal, so some schools have higher burdens than others, but hear me out.)

First, we divide our students up into three groups, by actually partnering with parents and hearing what their real needs are:

## Step 1 - Grouping


### Group 1 - The neediest kids


For sake of the argument, we will use two criteria (to keep it simple), but your school will absolutely need it’s own criteria.

Criterion 1: kids with special needs that need specially designed instruction. In most districts, this is usually 8-12% of the population.

With these kids, their parents can’t provide the instruction needed to help them progress. This doesn’t mean it is all the kids with IEPs, but those for whom the parents can’t provide support.

Criterion 2: Kids where both parents must work outside the home full time (essential workers, for example).

With these kids, there is no adult at home for them, and likely no older siblings at home either.

Support for Group 1

Kids who fall into group 1 will be invited back to school to meet regularly.

With this being a smaller number of the population, it will make all the other aspects of social distancing and exposure levels much lower.

If someone gets sick, they would still need to be sent home, and many may need to be quarantined, but this gives them the school structure that they need, and allows those who need it the most to have it.

### Group 2 - Some support at home


This group of students are those who have some support at home.

For sake of the argument, we will call support:

*  parent is home, even if that parent is working


*An older sibling is available (not ideal!) to provide limited support or the student is capable on his own.


*  student has access to technology and internet.

Support for Group 2

This group of students needs regular support and check-ins and help from school. For these students, office hours, online classes, and so much more are necessary.

They would be the second group that would be brought back to school as it becomes safe.

### Group 3 - They’ll be fine


This is the group of students who have parents at home who can support them, parents who want to be involved in their education, and the time to support that.

To be honest, this is the group that my family falls in. I’m an educator, my wife has a college degree. Honestly, our kids will be fine.

We can provide better support by taking control than by trying to do emergency schooling.

There are many families like this out there.

Support for Group 3

School will be there to support them as they request it.

Rather than creating content for these families, allow the families to do their own version of school and support that.

A teacher would be assigned to check in with the family as often as each family needs. For some families that could be once a month!

## Step 2 - Managing the groups


Once we have the kids in groups, we can make plans for those groups.

Group 1 - Kids back in school. This would be a much smaller group, social distancing can be implemented, cleaning and other safety protocols as well.

Group 2 - Kids at home, but engaged in virtual instruction and learning (developed by the teachers for that school). They would be the next group that would come back to school physically.

Group 3 - Kids at home where the families are in charge of their learning. This is the last group to come back.

## Step 3 - What about teachers?


Teachers are people. We need to treat them with respect and support as well.

First of all, teachers who can’t or don’t want to be in front of kids right now should be given the opportunity to lead the charge on online support.

Teachers may not be against the idea of coming back to school, if they know they are only going to be dealing with a small group of students daily, and will be able to practice safety protocols.

We also need to adjust our expectations of what teachers do.

A 3rd grade teacher may not be able to just teach 3rd grade anymore.

We may need to reassign some teachers to be online only teachers, and some to be in person, and some to adjust their position to one of a coach or learning support.

One reopening plan from my 
[workshop](http://jethrojones.com/reopen) grouped students by family into homerooms, so instead of kids arranged by grade levels, they are arranged by family. With just one child that doesn’t make any difference, but if you have three kids in the same family, it can really help them.

We need to reassess how we do what we do. This is just one of many possible solutions.
