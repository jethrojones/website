He has worked all over the world helping schools improve and currently hosts the model school conference which showcases the 40 top performing schools in the country.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other nations were doing some things better than us, but not everything. One thing we do much better is educating ALL students.</li>
<li>No nation in the world that would do what public education was doing for my family.</li>
<li>Spoke in 29 nations in 2 years.</li>
<li>Pulled company back to focus on America.</li>
<li>Carefully interviews people who need help, and mentor the schools to help them.</li>
<li>5,000 - 8,000 people at <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/2015-model-schools-conference/event-summary-7982b0b7d11e4fbd9d4bd8d06147b303.aspx?ct=59458a8c-b962-48fc-b8b3-eae7e385e2d2">Model Schools Conference in June</a>.</li>
<li>Teaming is important. We have created artificial silos that don&rsquo;t help students learn in real-life situations. School</li>
<li>Rigor, Relevance, and Relationships for ALL students</li>
<li>Schools are organized for ease of the teachers, not students.</li>
<li>Schools are organized for the top 1/3 of the students.</li>
<li>Want to motivate kids? Better make it relevant for them.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary teams.</li>
<li>To start find two people who are willing to work together and go from there.</li>
<li>Build your master schedule around them.</li>
<li>Takes about 3&ndash;5 years for these initiatives to work.</li>
<li>We need the common planning period between disciplines.</li>
<li>Gotta pick the battles you are going to fight.</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s too revolutionary and revolutionists get killed.</li>
<li>Breaking staff into thirds - Lunatic Fringe (let&rsquo;s do every new initiative), Realists (I need some data to change first), Over My Dead Body (I&rsquo;m not changing for nothing!). And it is not always broken down into even thirds.</li>
<li>Just leave the bottom third alone. Spend your time and resources on the top third.</li>
<li>Took 7 years working with that district for Brockton High School to start changing.</li>
<li>Teachers need an ongoing network of people beyond their own building.</li>
<li>Running Interference: Find ways to unlock teachers potential and remove roadblocks (state regs, parents/kids, union).</li>
<li>Get parent advocates. Talk to the parents of students who are doing a really great job. Get that parent to run for school board. Over time, it grows.</li>
<li>Public education has been around for a long time, you won&rsquo;t change it overnight.</li>
<li>Measure what matters.</li>
<li>Academic Tenacity - do kids feel school is relevant? Do they feel safe? WE Surveys help find out if kids feel connected to school.</li>
<li>Do students and teachers agree that what is being taught is relevant?</li>
<li>Student and parent engagement are important.</li>
<li>Content, Methodology, Academic Tenacity, Parent/Community. We are so hung up on Content, that we can&rsquo;t get to next three items. High performing schools don&rsquo;t begin with content, they begin with getting the kids engaged.</li>
<li>Culture trumps strategy.</li>
