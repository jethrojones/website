As Staci says, I don't need a piece of paper to show that I am a good teacher. (While that may be true, I do need a piece of paper to keep my job, not necessarily good teaching skills. Is that backwards? Yes.)<br /><br />Anyway, I am glad to have my license, so only three more years of evaluations and I will be able to be a "career" teacher. Yippee for job security, if I make it that long!<br /><br />*For those of you who don't know, I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in English, with an emphasis in professional writing, and a minor in Russian. After graduating, I decided that I wanted to be a teacher, and so I went through <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.schools.utah.gov%2Fcert%2FAPT%2FARL%2Fdescription.htm&amp;ei=YkLgSObOOYm4sAPq_dTjAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRF42KIAYYzmiJm-DJZLQTpx2fLA&amp;sig2=AKglcfrGjXvHxP5TFAPgkQ">Alternative Routes to Licensure</a>. The program lets me take a bunch of classes while still having a real teaching job. Personally, I learned far more on the job than I ever learned in the classrooms, and I think I am a better teacher for it. Someday, I'll give my ideas for what a real teacher preparation program should look like.
