Despite the title, I'm not an IT department.

Several years ago, I learned about [thin clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client), which basically are computers designed to be low performance and low cost and have a connection back to a server where all the magic happens!

Was that oversimplified enough?

Over the last three months, I have had some major computer trouble and have gone through three brand new computers that just didn't work out. Hopefully the third time is a charm.

I use a lot of specialized software and services for [my work](https://jethrojones.com/), but what I noticed is that each time I have gotten a new computer, the transition has taken fewer and fewer hours.

I'm utilizing cloud storage solutions for a large part of my work. Dropbox as backup might not be the best solution, but it sure has come in handy.

My computer is certainly not a low-performance device, but most of my data being stored in the cloud makes it seem like it is performing the role of thin client.

What truly amazes me is that I can get a new computer at the end of the day the night before and be ready for work the very next morning.

For example, I've started using [Descript](https://descript.com/) to edit my podcasts, and in the past, I'd be very worried about a new computer and losing all my saved data, and progress on podcasts I'm in the middle of editing. 

Descript is nice for the features it provides, but it's also very comforting knowing that all my stuff is there in the cloud, ready for me to download as I need it. That's pretty comforting. It also makes it super easy to share with my editor. 

Right now, I'm enjoying this thin client life.
