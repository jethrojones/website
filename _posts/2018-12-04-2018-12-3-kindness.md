I saw an act of kindness by a teacher the other day that was really great.

She saw a student do something that wasn't right.

She gave him the teacher look, and he stopped.

She said, "I know I don't have a relationship with him, and so if I said anything to him, it wouldn't matter. I got him to stop, but I know I can't change his behavior without a relationship. I need to talk to the teacher that does have a relationship with him."

Why is this kindness?

She honored that student by thinking of his needs before her need to be "right." She thought of him and his growth, and rather than lecture him yet again, she cared enough about his growth to say, "I'm going to get the right person to talk with him when he is calm."

It's inspiring.
