>Students consistently monitored themselves, their learning, and behavior, invested in their goals and plans of action, and achieved beyond anything I could have put forth for them at the time. By relinquishing control and utilizing the number one resource in my classroom, rigor was increased on all levels.



The biggest problem with student led conferences is that parents still want the "inside scoop" from the teacher. It'd be great if we could figure out a way for the students to have that information, and tell parents honestly.
