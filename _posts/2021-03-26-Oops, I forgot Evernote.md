March 22, 2021

I started using Evernote in 2008, so I had left out the 2000+ notes in my post [Stumbling into Personal Knowledge Management](https://world.hey.com/jethro/stumbling-into-pkm-4711564e).

Evernote served as a catchall for other things.

The first note I create din Evernote was a DeBeers class action lawsuit document. I paid for a year of Evernote with that settlement. haha!

I found this [great post](http://www.markwk.com/migrate-evernote-plaintext.html) for getting my Evernote Database into Obsidian, and, while it was kind of a pain, it was actually pretty fun, since I like the nerdy stuff. 

Still haven't figured out how to get my images to be embedded. I figured it out manually, but can't figure it out automatically using that post as help. 

Notes created in \[\[Evernote\]\] by year. 

2008: 1  
2009: 6  
2010: 1  
2011: 5  
2012: 13  
2013: 10  
2014: 142 <- The year I met Damon, who really extolled the virtues of Evernote  
2015: 166  
2016: 259  
2017: 281  
2018: 127  
2019: 43  
2020: 0  
2021: 920 <- I lost the date created on these files. Not sure why. 

Obviously, I wasn't a heavy evernote user.
