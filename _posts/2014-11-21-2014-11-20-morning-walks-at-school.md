>Every morning Anastasis Academy students start with a mile walk. Together. We donâ€™t walk by class, or by age. We walk together in community. Sometimes (when the weather is nicer) whole families join us, dogs included. It is a great way to start off the day. Directly following the walk, our students come together for a morning meeting.



This Anastasis Academy sounds better all the time.
