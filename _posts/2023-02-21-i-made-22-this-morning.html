<p>Sometimes you get in a situation where your options have lost value or gained a lot of value and you need to do something. That’s what I did last week. </p><p>If you remember from last week, I had sold calls on SOFI. The price of SOFI was pretty volatile last week, and then it dropped a lot at the end of the week. I’ll get into the details in a minute! </p><p>Rolling options is a strategy used by options traders to extend or <strong>adjust the terms</strong> of an existing options contract. This involves closing out an existing options position and simultaneously opening a new position with similar but different terms. </p><p>You can’t open a new position on a different stock, that’s not rolling. </p><p>Rolling means you adjust the: </p><ul><li><p>expiration date</p></li><li><p>strike price</p></li><li><p>or both</p></li></ul><p>In this situation I did both. Details below. </p><p>Also, I didn’t trade any options for <span class="cashtag-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;symbol&quot;:&quot;$RUM&quot;}" data-component-name="CashtagToDOM"></span> this week because they have an earnings call on Friday. It’s usually not a good idea to do options the week of earnings call, so I will just let it ride this week. </p><p></p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p> </p>
