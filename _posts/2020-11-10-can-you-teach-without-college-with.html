While co-founding the Learner Council and volunteering at virtual camps in her distributed learning high school, she discovered a passion for guiding and supporting other learners, and for creating systems that work. She wants to help other kids to experience learning the way she did by designing and supporting individualized learning paths.</p> <ul> <li>What is a distributed learning high school?</li> <li>Enrolled in a program where you had lots of power over your learning.</li> <li>Created our own curriculum through grade 9.</li> <li>Still a diploma granting program, but in Grade 10 switched to a thematic learning system.</li> <li>There weren’t courses, but projects and ideas that were combined in a theme.</li> <li>Having the opportunity to see connections between things is really important.</li> <li>Find something you are interested in and delve into it.</li> <li>Learner council was like a student council, and we didn’t have one.</li> <li>Many students saw struggles with all the changes.</li> <li>One student got fed up with all the changes and decided we needed a student council.</li> <li>The model was based on the idea that every student should be heard.</li> <li>Our school was so happy to have learner initiative.</li> <li>Challenges were creating space for kids to talk with us.</li> <li>We did all of our communication online.</li> <li>Each learner has a learner consultant that they talk with at least weekly.</li> <li>The school organized events (like camps) that were in person.</li> <li>Befriended the communications team within the school.</li> <li>Forum space set up to meet with</li> <li>Tools to be successful</li> <li>Reach out and ask for what I needed.</li> <li>There was lots of support, but kids weren’t making use of their educators.</li> <li>Found it useful to find out who was doing what.</li> <li>I feel bad for my educators, because I asked a lot of them.</li> <li>What to do now?</li> <li>I could not join the educator team because I don’t have a college degree.</li> <li>There are definitely uses for college.</li> <li>I don’t want to teach a class, I want to facilitate learning.</li> <li>Different ideas to help people.</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal? Offer kids options as to how to express their learning. Because not everyone is going to learn the same way and not everyone is going to want to do it the same way.</li> </ul> <h2 id="todayssponsors">Today’s Sponsors</h2> <h3 id="teachfx"><a href= "http://teachfx.com/transformativeprincipal">TeachFX</a></h3> <p>Innovative school leaders across the country have started tracking online student participation using TeachFX because it’s one of the most powerful ways to improve student outcomes during COVID — especially for English Learners and students of color.
