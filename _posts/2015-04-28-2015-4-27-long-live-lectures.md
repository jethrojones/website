George Couros:


>Anything done too much, will lose it’s impact.  This could be true of any type of learning.  Variety is powerful, but what works for you, doesn’t mean it works for someone else and we have to remember that sitting and hearing a great story, can make a huge impact on learning.  A great lecture is like an art form, and making a personal connection to content, helps others do the same for themselves.



Pretty powerful stuff. If lectures are so bad, why are we so ensnared with TED talks. Good teaching is about engaging your kids. If you do that through a lecture, go for it. If you do that through maker spaces, go for it. If you do that through X, go for it.
