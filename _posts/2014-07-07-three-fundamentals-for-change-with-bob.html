<p>In this first part of the interview, we discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A little about Bob&rsquo;s history and what he learned to help him become prepared for being a transformative principal.</li>
<li>Bob focuses on making sure all students are doing their best, not just particular subgroups.</li>
<li>What prepared Bob to be a principal: being a coach and a special education teacher.</li>
<li>What barriers prevent a school from being ready for change.</li>
<li>Three fundamentals that are needed to change:<ol>
<li>Why do we exist</li>
<li>Describing a perfect school</li>
<li>What are we going to do to make sure we get there!</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Conversations about structural change take time and informal and formal conversations with teachers, students, parents, and other stakeholders.</li>
<li>All the voices have to be in the room!</li>
<li>Establishment of norms are critical for the success of our school, and while we want to hear everyone&rsquo;s concerns, we will move forward with the will of the group.</li>
<li>The norms for Bob&rsquo;s schools.</li>
<li>The need for &ldquo;critical friends&rdquo;.</li>
<li>How he deals with the fact of hearing that he is doing something wrong.</li>
<li>One of the best interview questions: &ldquo;Anticipate a mistake you are going to make, and how you will resolve that!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
