<a href="http://technothursdays.wikispaces.com/session4">TechnoThursdays wiki for this session</a>.<br /><br />You can watch the video at the link above, if you choose. Please fill out the survey, too.<br /><br />This week's session was way better than last week's. I felt really rushed last week, and the class didn't go very well. I think Google Docs takes a mental shift. I don't think most of them were ready for it. I am frustrated with myself for not being aware that it would be difficult. I should have known.<br /><br />This week we did blogs. We set up blogs so that the teachers could post updates to their blogs each day about what they did in class. I think this is a great because they can make their lives easier. Students who need assignments from the previous day can get it there.<br /><br />What made tonight's TechnoThursday really successful?<br /><ol><li>I was very prepared.</li><li>I was teaching them something they could use right away.</li></ol>As a teacher of adults, I need to be prepared. As a teacher of adults, I need to teach them something that they can meaningfully use right away.<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
