<p>In the context of a democratic society, the role of education extends beyond the mere transmission of knowledge; it serves as a foundation for the formation of engaged, thoughtful, and values-driven citizens. While Westheimer and Kahne propose the idea of "justice-oriented citizens," my experience suggests that this term focuses more on <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/9da6f417">activism</a>, which often implies a lack of collaboration and a tendency to impose one's views on others. Instead, I propose a more nuanced approach to citizenship education, one that focuses on fostering values-driven citizens.</p><p><a href="https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/89416432">Westheimer and Kahne</a> admit that "politics and the interests of varied groups are often deeply embedded in the ways we conceptualize and study efforts to educate for democracy."</p><p>I see this as a fault in our system. I propose there are four pillars of democratic education: establishing and testing values, adult guidance and skills development.</p><h3>The Four Pillars of Democratic Education</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Establishing Values</strong>: First and foremost, education in a democracy must provide students with the opportunity to establish their own values. This is not about indoctrination but about creating a safe space where students can explore, question, and form their own belief systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing Values</strong>: Once values are established, students need the space to act on these values. Values are abstract concepts until they are tested in real-world scenarios. It's through this testing that values gain meaning and depth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adult Guidance</strong>: The role of educators is crucial here. They should be caring, supportive, and challenging in a way that encourages students to question and affirm their own values. The goal is not for students to adopt the values of their teachers but to solidify their own. Students should not know what their teachers' values are because of the power and control that teachers wield over students on a daily basis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skills Development</strong>: Finally, students need to develop the skills necessary to enact or implement their values. This includes critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills that empower them to participate in&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;make meaningful changes in their communities.</p></li></ol><h3>The Values-Driven Citizen</h3><p>While Westheimer and Kahne categorize citizens as Personally Responsible, Participatory, or Justice Oriented, I propose a different type of citizen: the Values-Driven Citizen. This individual operates aligned to his or her own values and possesses the skills to engage in meaningful dialogue and action. Unlike the "justice-oriented" approach, which can be prescriptive and unilateral, the values-driven approach recognizes the importance of collaboration and the ability to stay true to one's own values while respecting those of others.</p><p>In summary, education in a democracy should aim to cultivate values-driven citizens who are equipped not just with strong personal values but also with the skills and opportunities to test and enact those values. This approach respects individual autonomy and encourages collaborative engagement, which are both essential qualities for the functioning of a democratic society.</p>
