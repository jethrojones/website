Transformative to do what? If you were to describe what you are trying to accomplish, define what is happening right now in your school. Think through how you frame things. Define what you perceive happening. Start to talk about what the difference is between what people are doing what you want them to do.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you’re going to have a safe school, everyone needs to be involved.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Are you feeling like you are always behind at school? Do you feel like you need about 2 more hours each day to accomplish everything?
