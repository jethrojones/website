<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>It is amazing how easy it is to ride my bike when I am not kneeing myself in the gut with every revolution. This picture is my phone's view as I am riding. I use <a href="http://mapmyride.com" title="MMR">MapMyRide.com</a> to track my distance, pace, speed, and calories burned. I rode home from the dinosaur museum today after going there with my kids. I thoroughly enjoyed riding again, and it seems like it is has been forever since I have been able to ride. I bought a long-sleeve compressor shirt for $5 at WalMart the other day, and it worked flawlessly. Last year, I only had a sleeveless shirt to wear when riding, so my season ended pretty early as it was too cold to keep going.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Last summer, my first ride was on March 15th, and I ended on September 13th. I rode&nbsp;588.4 miles (or 562.54 according to MapMyRide.com in that time. My goal this year is to ride 1000 miles before I am done. I am pretty sure I can do it. I am going to ride the <a href="http://www.bbtc.net/" title="ULCER">ULCER</a> this August, which is 100 miles, so that will pad my numbers pretty easily. Last year, I also did a lot of rides with the kids in tow, which caused me to do short, 6-mile rides. I won't be towing them this year as it cost me too much money in wear and tear on my bike.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I am really excited to see how I do this summer. I am looking forward to spending a lot of time on my bike. I enjoy it so much, it doesn't even seem like exercising (except when I am going uphill, that isn't as much fun).</p>  <p>This morning I was at 217 pounds, which means that the weight is finally starting to come back. I need to keep it off, and this exercising will certainly help that.&nbsp;</p>  <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'> <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-03-18/ttcgdygkxnfftgFllAChgBCdHvhpcpayjbxpvtczJghxvskskHijxbmHxHHl/Photo_Mar_18_9_29_44_PM.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"><img alt="Photo_mar_18_9_29_44_pm" height="655" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-03-18/ttcgdygkxnfftgFllAChgBCdHvhpcpayjbxpvtczJghxvskskHijxbmHxHHl/Photo_Mar_18_9_29_44_PM.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /></a> </div> </p></div>
