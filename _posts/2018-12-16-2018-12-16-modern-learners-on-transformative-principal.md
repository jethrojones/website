---Today on the podcast, I have an interview with 
[Will Richardson and Bruce Dixon of Modern Learners](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/modern-learners-with-will-richardson-and-bruce-dixon-transformative-principal-257/). It is a fantastic interview where they talk about Change.School and other great things that they are working on. 


We even go so far as to say that maybe all we need to teach is soft skills. 

Also, this week, I 
[released a bunch of interviews](http://www.jethrojones.com/blog/2018/12/14/synergy-success-stories) that I did with kids at my school who are doing amazing things during our synergy block.

Finally, this week your opportunity for signing up for 5 Days to Your Best Year Ever closes. Speaking of modern learners, I really believe that this approach, where you go find your own "courses" to take is the future, and it is already here. If you're still on the fence, join a 
[webinar right now](http://bestyearever.me/jjones/2019webinar)!

If someone interviewed with me for a job, and they said they had taken Michael Hyatt's goal setting strategies to heart, there would be some things that I could assume about them:

*​They care about their own personal growth


*They invest in themselves


*They set and achieve goals that are meaningful to them


*They are probably one of the best in their area

I can confidently assume all these things because ​I know Michael Hyatt's work. Even if I didn't know him, I would know all those things because that person participated in something that showed they had all the qualities. 

You have the chance to make 2019 better than ever, so join a
