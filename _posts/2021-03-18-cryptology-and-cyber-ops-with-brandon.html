A proud New Jersey native, he spent his formative years in the mid–2000s finding trouble on and off the Internet. After discovering the value of structure at the US Naval Academy, he went on to serve as an operations officer at the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command in Fort Meade, Maryland, and as the head of information warfare on USS Boxer in San Diego, California.
