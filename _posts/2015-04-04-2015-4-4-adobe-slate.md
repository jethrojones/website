Had some time to try out Adobe Slate today. Pretty amazing.


[This](https://slate.adobe.com/a/WD8nX) would be cool if it were embedded in my web site, but a link to it is not bad. It was easy to make something that had a cool design. Better pictures would make it even better, but it is still pretty amazing.
