Sam has great respect for both the art and science of teaching.&nbsp; He has demonstrated a great understanding of working effectively with school communities, teachers and administrators unions, elected officials, as well as students and faculty. He also served as Co-President of the Science Supervisors Association of New York City, and is currently a Trustee at the Syosset Public Library in his hometown. He is also an alumnus of New Leaders, a nationally recognized Principal Leadership Program.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sam grew up in Queens, New York, received his Bachelor of Science Degree from Syracuse University, a Master of Science in Botany and Plant Pathology from Colorado State University, and a Professional Diploma in Education Administration from Queens College.</p> <ul> <li>440 High Schools in NYDOC</li> <li>Tried to win over the people on the fence.</li> <li>Approaching kids with high expectations.</li> <li><a href= "https://www.thenewmvb.com/apps/video/watch.jsp?v=177767">College March Video</a></li> <li>How to approach racial tensions as issues.</li> <li>Shifting culture - consistent, real, unwavering.</li> <li>Newspapers wrote articles about us fixing the clock.</li> <li>Do we have to wear uniforms?</li> <li>How to be a transformative principal?
