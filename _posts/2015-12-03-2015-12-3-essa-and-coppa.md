[Special Education Law Blog: COPAA Statement on ESSA--Congratulations on Developing a Reasonable Compromise](http://blog.foxspecialedlaw.com/2015/12/copaa-statement-on-essa-congratulations-on-developing-a-reasonable-compromise.html)


>COPAA (Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc.) appreciates the bipartisan approach which Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott led in order to complete reauthorization of the ESEA. COPAA has worked diligently – as an independent voice as well as in key coalitions with business, disability and civil rights organizations – to inform and support the legislative process to help ensure that every child continues to have equal access to a high-quality education as well as equal opportunity to achieve his or her full academic potential. We congratulate you on developing a reasonable compromise. Although we have concerns about certain provisions of S. 1177, we write to let you know that we support the conference report and urge its adoption.



I haven't read the conference report yet. The highlights our state has been giving us certainly seem interesting.


There are some things that seem like bad ideas, but overall, it seems like a better step forward than the waivers.
