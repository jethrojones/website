I read [this post](https://world.hey.com/mattsmith/homework-9b0e2e76) about homework.

Here’s my philosophy as a school principal on homework:

It is unethical for schools to tell families what they should do at home, after school is out for the day.\*

Therefore, homework should not exist.

[Matt’s post](https://world.hey.com/mattsmith/homework-9b0e2e76) tells you more. 

Can you imagine how a teacher (or any other employee) would feel if a boss said, after they put in a full day of work, “OK, now you have to go do these meaningless assignments that I don’t even have time to review at home, and you’ll be penalized if you don’t do them, but don’t get anything extra if you do them!”? They’d go bananas. 

Wrong answers:

-   But teachers take work home all the time! Yes, but your own choice is different than it being a requirement. 
-   But kids have to practice! Sure they do, but guess what is a great use of time IN school: practice. 
-   But kids need to learn responsibility! Pass. There are plenty of ways to teach responsibility that don’t require all the negatives that go along with homework.  
-   But kids will have learning gaps if they don’t do homework! [False](https://world.hey.com/jethro/theres-no-such-thing-as-learning-loss-or-learning-gaps-or-what-learning-actually-looks-like-d6955108). 
-   But the research says! Nope. The research shows a correlation to higher achievement, but that’s like a snack food company bragging about higher cholesterol levels from eating their food. 

\*I’m only adding after school part because of the pandemic.
