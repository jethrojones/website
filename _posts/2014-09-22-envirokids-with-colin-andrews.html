Mr. Andrews is inspiring. He is doing so much cool stuff, we didn&rsquo;t have time to get to everything.</p>
<ul>
<li>We start by talking about the learning fellowship that Mr. Andrews did many years ago. A four way study looking at transition from elementary to middle and then to high school.</li>
<li>Forest, outdoor classroom, pest control, projects all directed by the kids.</li>
<li>Envirokids, through process of inquiry and student voice that create amazing things.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bhbint.school.nz/main.cfm?id=11213">Pathway and other Envirokids project</a></li>
<li>It is the ability of the teacher to be able to spot a question and really pursue it.</li>
<li>Structure of envirokids: two-three blocks of time on Fridays, one teacher, about 30 kids.</li>
<li>Working days for the families, kids need to bring one parent with them to participate in the work day (on the weekend).</li>
<li>How to make manual labor sound exciting?</li>
<li>4 Ethics - Academics, cultural, sporting, and service to the community. Recognized through everything they do all the year long.</li>
<li>Role of the advisor of Envirokids. One teacher teaches all academic subjects, so she changes her teaching on Friday to focus on the Envirokids.</li>
</ul>
