In a meeting today, the leader of the meeting (to be clear, not the leader of the group!) asked us a check in question. He asked two, but the first was such a good question because:

1.  It had nothing to do with our meeting
2.  It helped us get to know each other better
3.  It allowed us to dream
4.  It had constraints

These are not requirements for *every* check in question. But they are requirements for a *great* check in question. 

The question was: “If you were given $100 and were only allowed to spend it on yourself, what would you spend it on?”
