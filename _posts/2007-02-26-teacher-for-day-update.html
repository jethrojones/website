My student who taught last week wrote up a little response to what she thought of being a teacher for a day:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Being a teacher is not something that I would become when I grow up. A reason is because it's <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">boring</span> and you don't have fun. Besides, all the "students" ignore you and do whatever they want. It's hard being a teacher because you have to to [sic] thing so you can answer the students' questions, even though some questions are dumb, you still should know the answer. Now I know that it's not easy to be a teacher, it is actually pretty hard. </span></span><br /><br />I am glad that she was able to understand something from that experience.
