"It's too hard," she said. "Every time I drop him off, the tears, the yelling, and the crying. I just can't take him to school anymore. We've got to figure something out."</p> <p>We had talked about different things, from counseling to medication to other options.</p> <p>For the time being, our solution was that I would drop him off at school. For some reason, his reactions to his anxiety seemed to be less when dad dropped him off.</p> <p>Any parent who has experienced this knows how difficult it is to deal with the intensity of the emotions on a daily basis.</p> <p>This was especially challenging for me, because I struggled with this as well. All the way until I was 19, any new change was especially difficult. My heart broke for him every day, because I knew how powerless he felt.</p> <p>When he started kindergarten, we were living on a small island in the gulf of Alaska, and the community didn’t have the resources to offer a lot of help.</p> <p>We did all kinds of things to try and help, meditation apps, calming techniques, praying, blessings, and more, and nothing really seemed to work.</p> <p>When we moved to Fairbanks, we were ready to get more serious, but then he took care of this himself.</p> <p>Before I get to what actually happened, let me back up a bit.</p> <p>I read a book when I was 21 called “Write it down. Make it Happen.” Actually, I think I just read the first chapter or so. That was all I needed. It talks about the power of writing things down to make them come to fruition.</p> <p>Well, I wrote down a bunch of goals that I wanted to accomplish when I turned 30, and guess what? I accomplished them all.</p> <p>I’ve been a big believer in goals for a long time, and this really solidified what I knew.</p> <p>So, I decided to start setting goals with my family each week. My four kids would set their own goals every week, and my wife and I would set our goals. We share them with each other and track them on a piece of paper.</p> <p>Eventually, that has now grown into yearly and monthly goals we set with each other, and help hold each other accountable.</p> <p>Back to my son. We had set goals as a family for a couple years, and after we moved to Fairbanks, he started taking an interest in setting meaningful goals for himself.</p> <p>It started with little goals.</p> </div> </div> <div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1561585703967_37070" class= "sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready" data-block-type="5"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1563662293008_361" class="sqs-block-content"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1563662293008_360" class= "image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline combination-animation-slide-up individual-animation-none individual-text-animation-none animation-loaded"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1563662293008_359" class="intrinsic"> <div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1563662293008_358" class= "image-block-wrapper has-aspect-ratio" data-description=""><a href= "http://ourfamilycoach.com"><img class="thumb-image loaded" src= "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/4fffa949e4b0b4590d67b4e7/1561585926534-TTVG6QKT5A82B8PNF55O/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kK60W-ob1oA2Fm-j4E_9NQB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0kD6Ec8Uq9YczfrzwR7e2Mh5VMMOxnTbph8FXiclivDQnof69TlCeE0rAhj6HUpXkw/IMG_0572.jpeg?format=750w" alt="IMG_0572.jpeg" width="400" height="600" data-src= "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/4fffa949e4b0b4590d67b4e7/1561585926534-TTVG6QKT5A82B8PNF55O/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kK60W-ob1oA2Fm-j4E_9NQB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0kD6Ec8Uq9YczfrzwR7e2Mh5VMMOxnTbph8FXiclivDQnof69TlCeE0rAhj6HUpXkw/IMG_0572.jpeg" data-image= "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/4fffa949e4b0b4590d67b4e7/1561585926534-TTVG6QKT5A82B8PNF55O/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kK60W-ob1oA2Fm-j4E_9NQB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0kD6Ec8Uq9YczfrzwR7e2Mh5VMMOxnTbph8FXiclivDQnof69TlCeE0rAhj6HUpXkw/IMG_0572.jpeg" data-image-dimensions="2500x3333" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-load="false" data-image-id="5d13e8fbdb603700013e70e4" data-type="image" data-image-resolution="750w" /></a></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1561585703967_37345" class= "sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44"> <div class="sqs-block-content"> <p>We are pretty strict that we don’t tell the kids what goals they should set, but rather help them set their own goals.</p> <p>So, my son spent some time setting little goals like play with certain toys each day, or do his chores when he first got up, or play Minecraft.</p> <p>Then, one day, it happened.</p> <p>“My goal this week is to go to school without complaining.”</p> <p>My wife and I looked at each other in stunned silence. For over two years, this had been a battle, and now, he was saying he wasn’t going to complain.</p> <p>We played it cool, and said, “Good goal. Let’s see how it goes.”</p> <p>Honestly, we didn’t think he would do it.</p> <p>But sure enough, he got out of the car on Monday, without a single complaint. And each day after that, he has done the same.</p> <p>I’m not going to lie, having some AMAZING teachers who really cared about him and helped him has been a really powerful experience. But the thing that really made the difference has been him setting his own goal to be in control of his life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Get our goal sheet from <a href= "http://ourfamilycoach.com">OurFamilyCoach.com</a></p> </div> </div> <br /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://ourfamilycoach.com/">New Episode of @TrnFrmPrincipal</a></p>
