<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I've got a free trial code for educator.com if you are interested.&nbsp;I am a member of Bzzagent.com, which is a site that gives you products to review. For the last couple years, I haven't been very engaged in it, but this educator.com offer caught my eyes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>For the last year or so, I have been trying to teach myself how to code, which has been difficult at best. I am not very good at teaching myself stuff. I need someone to direct me and guide me. I like to have someone talking to me. So, what educator.com does is allow me to watch actual professors giving lectures. I think this is better than iTunesU in that it doesn't just put a camera up in their lecture hall and call it good. They actually get the professors into a room with a touchscreen monitor and a pen. So, you have three views in the videos, as shown in the pic below.&nbsp;<a href='http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-02-25/ilioHyisdGGBojnpkDihxfyaGaxjJdzrIcygtCcvnlCAmHwocfvdwyJbJJsd/Educator.png.scaled1000.png'><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-02-25/ilioHyisdGGBojnpkDihxfyaGaxjJdzrIcygtCcvnlCAmHwocfvdwyJbJJsd/Educator.png.scaled500.png" width="500" height="342"/></a> There is the computer monitor, which is an annotated slideshow, and then there is a camera on the professor. Finally there is a navigation window that allows you to skip forward in the presentation to different parts.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Overall, I think this is a pretty good way to learn. In schools, it would be a good supplement if a student didn't get something. For a non-student student, it is a really great way to learn on your own. Allegedly, you can even make comments on the videos and have them answered by professors so that actual help is provided. I am not sure yet how that works in real life, but that is one of their plugs.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Here is the best part: A school can have this in their labs for free. It costs $35/month or $240/year for home use. I really like the idea that this is free for schools. It is actually a pretty good marketing strategy because kids will never have enough time to watch all the videos in all the courses at school, and if it helps them, it would be a good way to get some help at home, at a much lower cost than a personal tutor.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Courses are available in Math (from MathMagic to Basic Math all the way up to Calculus and AP Stats), Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science (HTML Training,&nbsp;CSS Intro,&nbsp;Java,&nbsp;JavaScript,&nbsp;Introduction to PHP,&nbsp;Wordpress Training). They also have many AP courses available. All the courses are focused on Science and Math.&nbsp;</p>  <p>So, if you want to give it a shot, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>  <p><ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 20px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: arial, verdana; vertical-align: baseline; color: #5d5d5d; line-height: 20px; padding: 0px;">  <li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.educator.com/" target="_blank" style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #92bd40; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">http://www.educator.com</a>&nbsp;and click on "Create Account" or "Subscribe"</li>  <li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Make sure "<strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Basic Plan</strong>" is selected.
