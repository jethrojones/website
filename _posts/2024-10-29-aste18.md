###Using Personality Styles to Understand Your Students


This is a fun conversation about using personality styles to adjust how you interact with kids. This is powerful stuff that meets kids where they are and helps them bbe their best.

Here is a link to the slides (as a 
[Keynote file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2y2sq8qer68tiw/Personality%20Styles.key?dl=0)).
