In this episode we interview Lita and her daughter Katie about how they learned about technology in their home.</p> <ul> <li>What tech was like when Lita started teaching it to her kids.</li> <li>Babysitting devices &amp; gaming systems.</li> <li>How Lita introduced tech to her kids.</li> <li>Katie got her first laptop at 3. Used it for Freddie Fish, PuttPutt Saves the Zoo. Disk install. Stand-alone use – no connectivity.</li> <li>Katie’s friends’ thoughts on her not having a phone: Are your parents strict? Mom is a prude. (Mom always said to blame her.) Not “cool” kid. Lots of shit for not having it.</li> <li>How KATIE viewed the Internet: A blank space. Ask a question and answers come back. You had a purpose. A homework assignment to get info or music. No awareness of Search History, and later what the “cloud” was and what would be stored there.</li> <li>When friends started having home systems crash with viruses from their kids using their systems. Internet was disabled on the kids’ systems.</li> <li>What was happening in friends’ homes?</li> <li>How to help when kids cross the line</li> <li>What they would do differently.</li> </ul> <h2>Thanks to our mission partner:</h2> <p><a href="https://buoyancydigital.com">Buoyancy Digital</a> is proud to be the inaugural Mission Partner for the Cybertraps Podcast series.
