I finish all of my mastermind meetings and trainings with a simple question:

> What was most valuable to you today?

The question has two purposes:

1.  Help people verbalize why they attended the event.
2.  Feedback for me about what resonated with them. 

I want to help people realize what was good for them from what they attended. If they can’t think of anything that was valuable, then that’s on me, as the leader of the event. 

I got the question from a book called [The Coaching Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749). There are lots of other good questions to ask from that book.
