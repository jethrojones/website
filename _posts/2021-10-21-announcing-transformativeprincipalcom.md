FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

October 21, 2021 - Jethro Jones, Founder of Transformative Principal, just crossed a major milestone,  over 1M downloads of the Transformative Principal Podcast.  He’s celebrating with the launch of a new web site, 
[https://transformativeprincipal.com](https://transformativeprincipal.com), which focuses on helping principals lead schools that everyone can be proud of.

After starting in 2013 with an idea, one junky microphone and little to no editing skills, Jethro has created the longest running school leadership podcast out there with over 450 official episodes and  75 bonus episodes.  He touts downloads by school administrators  in every country of the world.

Jethro has interviewed giants both inside and outside of the education industry.  This unique blend of guests inspires and gives listeners hope that they can be transformative in their own schools as they hear awe-inspiring stories of other principals just like them who are making change happen.

Of the occasion, Jethro says, “I believe that every school administrator has a hero or heroine inside of them.   The challenges they face in leading a school are colossal, from Covid19 Responses, Political and Civil Unrest, Budget Shortages, Teacher Shortages, to everyday pressures leaders face while navigating to success.  Principals need a safe place they can go to share their dreams and goals as well as their frustration and challenges… The Transformative Principal Mastermind is that place, we help principals get the support they need, right when they need it.”

One of Jethro’s mastermind members, Digital Principal of the Year Trevor Goertzen said of working with Transformative Principal, “ in the last year I was honored to receive the NSSP digital principal of the year. And I truly think the mastermind group was a big part of helping me achieve that. The ideas I got from it, the encouragement and support I got from Jethro and other people in the group really, I think were part of helping earn that award as well.”

With a vision of impacting over 1000 school administrators in 2022, Jethro, is suring up his ranks by adding other experienced transformative principal facilitators to his ranks. Jethro welcomes Dr. Greg Goins to the Transformative Principal team. Goins is a veteran school administrator who has emerged as one of the nation's leading voices on visionary leadership as the voice of the nationally acclaimed Reimagine Schools Podcast.

Transformative Principal’s expansion will help serve even more school leaders and help principals lead a school that everyone can be proud of. Learn more at
