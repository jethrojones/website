<div class="p_embed_description"><b>EBLinfograph update.pdf</b> <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/jethrojones/HOsEaNhdexbBc1Oeboddc5x55Zv9GOH4tNjT2GOKf7XGiFo1HNCRG9R1xUdB/EBLinfograph_update.pdf">Download this file</a> </div></div>Even though I am not a graphic designer, I really appreciate the opportunity try to rub shoulders with those <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/tommybay">types</a> of <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/unculturedswine">people</a>. I like to read the things they share and analyze how they approach tasks and design. <br />
In education, design really takes a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=education+clip+art&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">back seat</a>. Sometimes, even in the trunk. Of course, there are <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/">exceptions</a> to the rule.<br />
I fancy myself as someone who pays attention to good design, and I think about it. "Thinking about it" is usually 95% of the solution. If you just look at it and think for a moment, you're more than most of the way there. <br />
So, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/PiperLaurie">Piper</a> and I got an assignment to collect and present some information on the time our office has spent on professional development with teachers this year. <br />
I compiled the data from 18 people and put it into a spreadsheet. We used Numbers, Pages, and <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> to create the infographic. <br />
I haven't ever used Acorn, but I bought it a few weeks ago, and I have been waiting for an opportunity to use it. I am glad something presented itself. <br />
The infographic itself is a Pages document (11 x 17). The images are from some image pack I downloaded years ago, but haven't had any reason to use. To get the triangle graphs, I had to create them in Numbers, then paste an image of them into a Pages document and "Mask with Shape..." to get them right. I wish I could mask graphs in Pages (or Numbers) with a shape. That would be really nice. I tried to do it in Acorn, but I couldn't figure that out either.&nbsp; Piper pulled the + signs from somewhere and Instant Alpha-ed the white background so they looked better. <br />
I thought it was pretty fun creating it. Even though it took a long time to do, it was worth it. I learned a lot, and created something beautiful in the end. <br />
Here is the Prezi my boss used in the presentation to the principals in the district:<br />
