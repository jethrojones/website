**Resources:**


We all received an email this week about the state choosing a new company for our state-wide test. 
[Here](https://vimeo.com/193465985) is the video they posted along with it: 
[https://vimeo.com/193465985](https://vimeo.com/193465985) I’m calling your attention to this because it is does a good job of explaining why we have state-wide assessments. Please take a few minutes to watch it.


[9 Simple Solutions for Common Teaching Problems](http://www.cultofpedagogy.com/hack-learning-series/): Here is a list of ways to make things easier for you as teachers. #4 is something that we did as an ad council before parent teacher conferences to help us have a consistent message K–12 about standards based grading.


[Action Research](https://overcast.fm/+DmFzfdGdU): This interview discusses how to use action research in your classroom. You all pretty much do this already, so here are some great ideas to help give a name to what you’re doing.


[GTD for Teachers](https://outofschool.net/?s=GTD&submit=Search): This is a three part series on the Out of School podcast about GTD. GTD is a methodology for “Getting things done” and something that we (in the KMS Committee) have talked about doing for our school. This episodes are “What is GTD?”, “GTD for Teachers”, and “GTD for Students” and the one for students was just released this morning, so I haven’t listened to it, yet.


Thanks,


Jethro
