Every single person knows how important exercise and physical activity is.

And yet, in our schools, we often take away recess as punishment, or as the only way to get extra opportunities for kids.

For example, in my daughter's school, she has a great music teacher, but the only place they can have choir is during recess. So, my daughter has to choose between free play and choir.

What could be cut from schools so kids don't have to choose between music and play?
