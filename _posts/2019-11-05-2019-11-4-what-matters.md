Sometimes, you will go through a big trial, especially a trial at work, and it will seem like that is the only thing that exists in the world.

It's not. There is so much more out there that you can't even fathom.

That was his work trial. What did that teach him? To go back and take bigger risks.

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger is the old adage. I think it's true.
