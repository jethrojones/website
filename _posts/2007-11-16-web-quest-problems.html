I make no assumptions that anyone reads this blog, so now that people are actually reading it, and commenting even, you also get to hear my reflective posts.<br /><br />The problem I ran into today was explaining that they need to fill out three source cards, but there was only one for the internet in the packet that I gave them. It is very frustrating that this happened. So, I had to make more.<br /><br />There are times as a teacher when you realize that it is a lot easier to change how you do things instead of dealing with the incessant confusion  by your students when what you are asking them to do makes perfect sense to you. This happens a  lot with me, which is probably a testament to my inability to be clear and organized...as this post is clearly an example of that!!!
