# 15 Back to School Event Ideas for 2021

After a crazy year coming off the pandemic, we're all hoping for getting everyone back to school in person. Here are some ways to celebrate and spend time time together with back to school events that will leave everyone excited for coming back to school. Additional Suggestions please send to [me@jethrojones.com](mailto:me@jethrojones.com)

## The Amazing Race

![looking at note](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/looking at note.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

One year we used an app called [Goosechase](https://www.goosechase.com/edu) (they even have an EDU version, which is affordable) to help everyone learn about the school and build relationships together.

  

Imagine your own local version of The Amazing Race! Super fun.

  
## Ice Cream Party!

We know food and dessert brings out the masses! Everybody loves dessert so it's a pretty easy way to get people to come to the school. With so many options available for so many needs, it's a great opportunity to serve your families with just what they need to start the year.

  

  

## Minute to Win it

![minute to win it](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/minute2winit.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

Minute to win it games are short, easy, and simple games that everyone loves!

[ScaryMommy](https://www.scarymommy.com/minute-to-win-it-games-for-kids/) has a great list of games for kids that you can incorporate into your back to school event. Whatever it is that you are planning, throwing in a few games will make it a big success, and give your families a chance to show their skills!

  

## Tailgate

![tailgate](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/tailgate.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)  

What makes any summer event more exciting? A tailgate! You can do anything at your tailgate from offering spiritwear to providing opportunities for parents to fill out volunteer forms to eating hot dogs, to tossing around a football, to simply socializing. Why not add in a little music from your local high school drumline to liven things up?


## School Carnival


![carnival](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/carnival.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)  
  

School carnivals are great because they can be as simple or as over-the-top as you want them to be! Holding one at back-to-school time can help set a fun tone for the rest of the school year. Provide classic activities like a ring toss, face-painting, and crafts or even add in some water play! Just make sure you communicate what will be there in advance so families know how to come prepared!

## School Supply Drive

  ![Supply drive](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/supply drive.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

A school supply drive is an easy way to make a big impact on students and their learning experience. Make either your school or a partner school a better place for both students and teachers by the simple act of providing school supplies.

[The AARP](https://createthegood.aarp.org/volunteer-guides/hold-school-supply-drive.html)has created a toolkit to help you get started!




## School Garden
![community garden](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/community garden.png&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

  

Have you always thought about starting a school garden but weren’t sure about how to go about it? Don’t do it yourself- get the whole school involved! School gardens are great places for learning, environmental stewardship, and pride, and can even improve your students’ diet and nutrition!

[The USDA](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2013/08/13/start-school-garden-heres-how) has some things to consider before getting started.Our school partnered with United Way to make our garden and it was a rousing success!


## Community Clean Up Day

![community cleanup](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/community cleanup.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

Trash cleanups are incredible for bringing communities together, protecting your local ecosystem, and ultimately, making a bigger impact on planet Earth. While it can be a very simple, yet effective, way to start off the school year, there are lots of things to consider when planning one. Check out

[Avocado Magazine](https://magazine.avocadogreenmattress.com/how-to-organize-a-community-cleanup-in-your-area/) for some tips. And don’t forget to include a celebration after the clean up!

## Color Fun Run

![color fun run](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/color fun run.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)  

Want a back-to-school kick off that will get all students, parents and the community at large involved? Fun Runs seem to fit the bill, and Fun Runs with COLOR are even better! Color Runs can get people involved who may have never even considered running before – and for schools, the more participation, the better!

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Holi-Powder-Chameleon-Colors-Authentic/dp/B06XCJYJVW/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&keywords=colored+powder&qid=1626848245&sr=8-11) has some color powder you can order online!


## Field Day
![field day](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/field day.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)


We all know and love Field Day, which is usually scheduled at the end of the year. But who says it can’t be at the beginning of the year, too, and involve both students and their families?!


## Graffiti Wall


![graffiti wall](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/graffiti wall.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)
  

Have a wall of your school (inside or out) that could use a little color? Invite students and their families to appropriately graffiti it with you! This can be a reflection of the community, a school theme for the year, or just their own personal expression. Looking for something a little less permanent? Use butcher paper to cover a wall inside of your building and graffiti that!

## Book Exchange and Picnic


![book exchange](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/book exchange.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)
  

A school book swap is a fantastic community event to attend and takes very little manpower to organize. Families can bring their own picnic and enjoy reading new stories while they eat! Books left over? Add them to the school library or donate them!

## Summer Olympics

  
![olympics](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/olympics.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

The summer Olympics provide a perfect excuse to rally your gang for some good, old-fashioned outdoor activities, a little healthy competition, and some great family fitness. For best results, choose challenges that play to a variety of strengths and abilities.


## Craft Hobby Show

![crafts](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/crafts.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)  

From face painting to needle working to wood carving, just about everyone has a hobby, and many are willing to lend themselves to demonstrations or sharing. Have a jewelry maker in your school community? Have them lead a jewelry making demonstration in your library. Have a quilter? Have them display them from trees outside! There are so many ways people can be involved in this event and an amazing opportunity to discover just how talented your school community really is!



## Garage Sale

![garagesale](http://images.weserv.nl/?url={{ site.url }}/assets/garagesale.jpg&w=450&output=jpg&q=65)

Think of this one as a mini flea market. Have your school community vote for something for which to fundraise throughout the year, have them clean out those garages and donate their goods while whole groups of bargain hungry shoppers can mark their calendars for the event and support your school’s goals!
