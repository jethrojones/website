##Catch the Trailer for the new podcast below:


























##Our first interview with Tessa Stuckey























I'm really excited to annouce a brand new podcast that I just started with Frederick Lane, author of the Cybertraps book series.

Here's what Fred says about the Cybertraps Series on his web site:

>Whether you are a young adult, teacher, parent, or just curious about the impact of your digital footprint, read Cybertraps to stay in the know of how technology can do significant harm to you, now and in the far future. While the world focuses on privacy data and how this affects us as a society, nationally-recognized cybersecurity and legal expert Frederick S. Lane delves deeply into how technology impacts us all at the most personal and intimate levels.


Fred and I will be interviewing experts in the fields of cybersafety, cybersecurity, big data, parenting and so much more.

We've already recorded a few episodes, and I am just so excited about the ground we are breaking here.

Each week, we will release one interview and do one live show.

This is the first episode, with an interview with Tessa Stuckey 
[@themomtherapist](https://instagram.com/themomtherapist). We have a wide-ranging interview about how to keep kids safe online.

Our live shows will be Mondays at 9 am Pacific. Right now, we will be broadcasting on 
[Facebook on the Cybertraps page](https://facebook.com/cybertraps).

I hope you'll subscribe whereever you listen to podcasts, and that you'll add this podcast to your regular podcast lineup!
