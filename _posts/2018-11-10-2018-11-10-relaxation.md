All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. While that proverb is probably most well-known from the 1980 movie, The Shining, there is real truth to that.

So many educators I know put their heart and soul into supporting kids. As a result, they are often left with little time to relax and something enjoyable.

What are you doing to relax this weekend? Is your "relaxation" rejuvinating or more work for yourself?
