>How to be a transformative principal: Find one way that you can use technology to do your job. If you carry around a smart phone and you can’t answer the question, how does my phone help me be a better principal, make it a goal to find out how it does help you do your job.
  What keeps him inspired: The things in my office that remind me of my faith and my daughter starting in preschool at my school.



I love learning from amazing principals. Mike Rogers has a lot of great information to share. Definitely worth a listen. If you want to know how to use your smart phone as a principal, this one is for you.
