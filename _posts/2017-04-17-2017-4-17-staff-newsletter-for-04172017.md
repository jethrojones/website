Hi Team,


**Upcoming Calendar Events**


The High School counselors are coming down to talk with 8th graders about courses for high school next year today and tomorrow. They are coming to Mrs. Grupp’s class on Monday and anyone who doesn’t have Mrs. Grupp or is absent will meet them in the library on Tuesday.


There is a spring band concert this Thursday in the High School Gym. On Thursday, students in band will be out of class for dress rehearsal.


This Friday teachers will meet in Department teams. We will start in the library for celebrations, and then break to your respective department meeting areas. Please let me or Mrs. Haffeman know if you need one of us there.

Both of these articles today are from Ian Byrd, a gifted and talented teacher with a pretty extensive web site about reaching gifted and talented students.


Have a great week!
