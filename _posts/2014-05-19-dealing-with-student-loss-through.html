Parker is the principal of Skiatook High School. <a href="http://www.williamdparker.com/about/">His web site</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/williamdp">Twitter</a>. He has also done some <a href="http://www.williamdparker.com/my-interviews/">amazing interviews himself</a>. I have learned a ton from reading those, and I am sure you will, as well.</p>
<p>Due to technical difficulties, we recorded our phone conversation, so the quality is a little old school. But, I almost felt like a radio DJ with a call-in show.</p>
<ul>
<li>What he learned as the Assistant Principal to the Principal at his school, who recently retired.</li>
<li>Bonuses for students who take all the assessments they are required to.</li>
<li>What skills he had to learn as an educational leader, that he wasn&rsquo;t taught in school.</li>
<li>Key Responsibilities Areas from <a href="https://www.entreleadership.com">Entreleadership</a> tells people who is in charge of what area. Here is his <a href="http://www.williamdparker.com/2013/09/04/using-kras-to-increase-effectiveness/">blog post about KRAs</a>.</li>

<li>Maintain as much stability as possible.</li>
<li>Open to creative and spontaneous.</li>
<li>Show appreciation to the kids who are present.</li>
<li>Tried to communicate well to media.</li>

</ol></li>
