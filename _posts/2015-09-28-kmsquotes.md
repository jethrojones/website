---International Podcast Day is coming up on September 30th! The students at my school are going to make a quote podcast so middle schoolers everywhere have an inspiring quote to listen to every single day.

We need your help.

Please record yourself reading your favorite quote and send it to me. Please include your name in the recording. First name is fine. 

You can email it to jjones03@kibsd.org

You can upload it to 
[this link](https://dropitto.me/jethrojones) (password is forjethro).

Please take a minute or two to record your favorite quote so we can have it for our students.

If you don't want to record it, you can just send me your favorite quote in an email, on Twitter (@jethrojones), or on Facebook. 

Thanks so much.
