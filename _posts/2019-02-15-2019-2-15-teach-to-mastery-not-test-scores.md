It's always good to review great TED talks. Here's 
[one by Sal Khan](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_teach_for_mastery_not_test_scores/discussion?ref=nf).

Even though this conversation has been going on for years, we are still, by and large, still doing school the same way we have always done it.

What will it take for us to move to a mastery or competency-based system? We need to have the conversations.

The hard part is that it is hard. It takes effort for teachers, who already work hard, to do things differently. To stop trying to cover, and start trying to ensure mastery.

A real question is, what happens when kids start to master things?

They start to believe they can do it.

Can you imagine if 
all kids started to believe they could learn anything?
