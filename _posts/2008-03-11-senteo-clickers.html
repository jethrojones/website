I use iClickers in my Politics class down at BYU, and it they are pretty nice. Last week I learned about <a href="http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/Products/Senteo/default.htm">SmartTechnology's Senteo</a> system which is pretty neat. The video below will give you a taste of it.<br /><br /><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" height="574" width="508"> <param name="movie" value="http://content.screencast.com/bootstrap.swf"> <param name="quality" value="high"> <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"> <param name="flashVars" value="thumb=http://content.screencast.com/media/a37c9235-b158-41df-98c2-065da016a1d4_6b5ba21b-5720-4de3-ae79-882494ea575c_static_0_0_Thumbnail.gif&amp;content=http://content.screencast.com/media/c79bbf5a-547f-4cec-af6a-55c08cfaeb46_6b5ba21b-5720-4de3-ae79-882494ea575c_static_0_0_00000095.swf&amp;width=508&amp;height=574"> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <param name="scale" value="showall"> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"> <embed src="http://content.screencast.com/bootstrap.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="thumb=http://content.screencast.com/media/a37c9235-b158-41df-98c2-065da016a1d4_6b5ba21b-5720-4de3-ae79-882494ea575c_static_0_0_Thumbnail.gif&amp;content=http://content.screencast.com/media/c79bbf5a-547f-4cec-af6a-55c08cfaeb46_6b5ba21b-5720-4de3-ae79-882494ea575c_static_0_0_00000095.swf&amp;width=508&amp;height=574" allowfullscreen="true" scale="showall" height="574" width="508"></embed> </object><br /><br />The nice thing about it that there are so many possibilities with it. Here is a <a href="http://www.screencast.com/users/jethro/folders/Jing/media/f0ec54cb-a635-4e65-a3a2-975c08e77371">video</a> of the action with my students participating. So, here is the neat thing: at our school, we are supposed to give assessments and analyze the data. They want us to do really in-depth data analysis. This spreadsheet shows what Senteo exports. This is great because if you make these lists (which I am not sure how to do) you can show only those who missed certain questions, or those who got certain questions right. It is really neat.  <br /><br /><iframe width='500' height='300' frameborder='0' src='//spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pz7asWMHcnnh41I4cdh4pRA&output=html&gid=0&single=true&widget=true'></iframe><br /><br />With these spreadsheets, you can see how well you teach certain topics, see how you need to improve, see if a question is throwing everybody off. You can also find students that are doing really poorly, and figure out how to differentiate instruction for them. <br /><br />Have a Good Life.
