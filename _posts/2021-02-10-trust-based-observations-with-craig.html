Author of Trust-Based Observations</p> <p>Trust-Based Observations, my new book about a transformative method of doing teacher observations. In a nutshell the book and model are designed to help show administrators how to build trusting differentiated relationships with each of their teachers such that teachers are willing to work through uncomfortable feelings of vulnerability and embrace taking big risks to grow their practice. The model also directly connects the observation process to annual action research goals and schoolwide professional development through the creation of professional development communities tied directly to TBO areas of pedagogy.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>What is wrong with our current observation protocols?</li> <li>Everything has been well-intended, it just hasn’t been effective.</li> <li>Gates Foundation 7 year research project to improve quality of teaching.</li> <li>Matt O’Leary - predominate researcher on teacher observation.</li> <li>When we evaluated teachers, they start to play it safe.</li> <li>If we create the right environment, everyone will feel safer.</li> <li>12 observations/week.</li> <li>Monday-Thursday 3 20 minute observations.
