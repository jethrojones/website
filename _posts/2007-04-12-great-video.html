<p>This video is a little like the one I posted previously, but it is better and longer (about 8 minutes). The really neat thing about this is that it was made by someone at my school district. I need to get in touch with this guy, and see if I can't get him to help me get some better stuff going. The <a href="http://t4.jordandistrict.org/payattention">website</a> he links to is pretty informative. <object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/aEFKfXiCbLw"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/aEFKfXiCbLw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></p>
