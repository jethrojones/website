I have been using Blogger as my blogging platform of choice for two and a half years. It is very easy to use, pretty fast, and I don't have too many complaints. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't host files. That frustrates me, especially when I try to help teachers use it for school, and they can't attach their files to it. You can use Google Docs, but I have found that Google Docs requires a paradigm shift for most people that they aren't quite willing to make.<br /><br />When I write for <a href="http://theappleblog.com/">The Apple Blog</a> I use Wordpress, which many people have mentioned is much better than Blogger. So far, I do like it a lot. It works well if you know a little more about computers because you can customize it much more than you can Blogger. Blogger is much more simple, and that has its own appeal as well.<br /><br />Do you know which platform I refuse to use? Typepad. And here is why: their comment system stinks! Whenever I want to post a comment, I click the submit button. The Web site sends the request to show me a page that says my comment has been submitted, so I think it is all done. Well, that is wrong, because this happens every time: about 20 minutes later, I browse through my tabs to see what is open, sometimes to see if anyone has responded to my comments. When I do this on a Typepad blog, I get the screen below:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVUktKsvrazQ3lvYJzdbsdNj9DubdopLe1LLiH6QDBgbcBGQiiYlOvIZpYFW60_xGCzc5o6vzvqbf54mEKsRwUdnhT4b0dk7rvmfua-psaXnrgKE27kDWcltOWHUtrFdWIrKA_INxCV9QS/s1600-h/typepad.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVUktKsvrazQ3lvYJzdbsdNj9DubdopLe1LLiH6QDBgbcBGQiiYlOvIZpYFW60_xGCzc5o6vzvqbf54mEKsRwUdnhT4b0dk7rvmfua-psaXnrgKE27kDWcltOWHUtrFdWIrKA_INxCV9QS/s400/typepad.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5200630030950239234" border="0" /></a><br /><br />It is still waiting for me to put in the correct Captcha letters/numbers. Despite the fact that I hate these things, I always mess up the Typepad Captcha. In the picture above, can you see where I messed up? I sure can't. But, sure enough, I had to enter another response to this Captcha. So this happens every time I post a comment on a Typepad blog. I don't think I have ever entered the Captcha correctly on the first try. By the third try, I just give up. Typepad makes it so hard to leave a comment, it is just ridiculous.<br /><br />If they make it so hard to leave a comment, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to even enter a post! Typepad can do some things to make it a better system:<br /><ol><li>Have the anti-spam question, Captcha, or whatever it is, on the page where you leave your comment. Don't make us think there just isn't one.</li><li>Change the Captcha system. Perhaps it times out after too much time. It is easy to let it sit there for a while when you expect your comment to just appear.</li></ol>Just these two changes would, I am sure, increase the amount of comments on posts. Am I alone here, or do you share my feelings?<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
