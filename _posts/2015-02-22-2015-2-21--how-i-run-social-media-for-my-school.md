This is a video that will walk you through the process, step by step.




Managing multiple social media accounts can be a tricky (and possibly expensive) endeavor. It is therefore imperative that you find a way to make it easier on yourself. I have a process that I use to post everything to all my social media pages for my school (
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kodiakmiddle), 
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/kodiakmiddleschool), and 
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KodiakMiddleSchool)). For me to be successful, this needs to be an easy and intuitive way to interact with my stakeholders.

#It All Starts with Instagram


Instagram is the hardest platform to get information into. For some reason, they don't allow you to post through anything other than the official app, which makes it difficult and annoying to post. If anybody does know how I can improve this workflow, please let me know.

I start with Instagram because everyone loves pictures (and videos), and they get the most interaction.

Whenever I think I want to share something with the community, it goes on instagram, with #KodiakMS somewhere in the text accompanying the picture (or video).

I use a school-issued iPad with the instagram app installed and signed into the school instagram account.

#Then it is Automated


I set up recipes in 
[IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) to make it easy to post to all the other social networks without any further interaction from. I use a school account for IFTTT.

Here is a handy flowchart to help make sense of it all.

Here are the recipes that I use, that you may use also.

[![IFTTT Recipe: If video posted to Instagram, link post to School Facebook Page. #edchat connects instagram to facebook-pages](https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/262057)](https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/262057-if-video-posted-to-instagram-link-post-to-school-facebook-page-edchat)




This recipe is for videos posted to Instagram. It creates a link post on Facebook.

After that video link post is on Facebook, it will now post it to Twitter. This also makes sure that the school hashtag shows up.

This recipe ensures that all photos on the school's Instagram end up on the school's Facebook page.

[![IFTTT Recipe: Photo posted to School's Facebook page also goes out to School's Twitter. connects facebook-pages to twitter](https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/262061)](https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/262061-photo-posted-to-school-s-facebook-page-also-goes-out-to-school-s-twitter)




This recipe takes any pictures posted to Facebook and publishes them as an image tweet as well. Add your school's hashtag to this recipe. This will also post any other picture to the Twitter, in case you post directly to Facebook instead of through instagram.

[![IFTTT Recipe: Any School Facebook update goes to Twitter, too.  connects facebook-pages to twitter](https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/262062)](https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/262062-any-school-facebook-update-goes-to-twitter-too)




Finally, this recipe just makes sure that all the admins post to your school Facebook page get sent out to Twitter, too.

[![IFTTT Recipe: If a tweet with a particular hashtag is tweeted, text me. #edchat connects twitter to sms](https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/262063)](https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/262063-if-a-tweet-with-a-particular-hashtag-is-tweeted-text-me-edchat)




This final recipe is in my personal IFTTT account. It texts me everytime there is a use of #kodiakMS on Twitter. It serves as a way to make sure I know that things are working, and as a way to know if something inappropriate gets up there.

Here are some screen grabs to show you how it works:

So, that is how I manage Instagram, Facebook Pages, and Twitter for total Social Media domination! 

 

I hope it helps you. 

 

Have a Good Life.
