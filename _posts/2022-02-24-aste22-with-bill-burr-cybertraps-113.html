At the most basic level, there are issues of distraction and student honesty. But other more serious concerns have emerged. Virtually every student carries a powerful tool for recording the world around them and publishing nearly instantly to a global audience. Moreover, the extensive use of remote instruction has given students endless opportunities to record their instructors. Some students have taken such footage to make mocking or even defamatory social media posts about their teachers. These are deeply challenging issues that require a response not only from school communities but also political leaders and social media companies.<br /> - #2022–02–20 – “Cybertraps for Educators 3.0”<br /> - Resource page for Hawai’i HSTA lectures<br /> “https://www.cybertraps.com/hsta–2022-additional-resources/”<br /> - This presentation is a preview of my June 2022 publication of the third edition of my book, “Cybertraps for Educators.” In addition to providing updates of new hardware and software that has emerged over the past two years, “Cybertraps for Educators 3.0” reorganizes digital risks for teachers into three distinct categories: personal, professional, and criminal. Educators will get a thorough overview of current cybertraps, the applicable provisions of the Model Code of Ethics for Educators, and practical steps that they can take to minimize their personal and professional risks.<br /> - #2022–02–21 – “The Cyberethics of Remote Instruction”<br /> - It turns out that nothing will drive the roll-out of remote edtech than a global pandemic. We have all had a crash course in the use of remote communication and educational tools. Although the majority of schools have returned to in-person instruction, the persistence of the pandemic and the threat of future viruses means that remote instruction, to one degree or another, is here to stay (particularly in geographically-expansive states like Alaska). What are the unique challenges and concerns arising from remote instruction? What did we learn–or what should we have learned–from the pandemic ?<br /> - #2022–02–21 – “Does Your Social Media Feed Have Any FERPA Violations?”<br /> - The Family Education Records Privacy Act (https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/) is designed to protect the privacy rights of students. As with so many other things, the combination of social media and mobile devices has made adherence to this law much more challenging. Even accidental disclosure of personally identifying information on school records can have serious legal and personal consequences. This presentation will offer a basic overview of FERPA, discuss the potential cybertraps for educators, schools, and school districts, and offer educators practical information for avoiding unnecessary mistakes.</p> <br /><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/cybertraps/Cybertraps_113.mp3?dest-id=2561582">Check out this episode!</a></p>
