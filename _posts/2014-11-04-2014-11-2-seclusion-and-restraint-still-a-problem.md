>The practices were employed at similar levels during both the 2011-2012 school year and the 2009-2010 year, according to a review of federal education data conducted by researchers at the University of New Hampshire.
  
  
Between those time periods, the report indicates that about half of states revised their policies on restraint and seclusion.
  
  
The analysis found that 69 percent of school districts reported no use of restraint and 87 percent did not use seclusion, but a small percentage of districts had “exceedingly high rates.” School districts at both the high and low ends were found in nearly every state.



I'd imagine that the real issue is that people don't know how else to deal with kids with special needs. They are likely afraid of what they can do. At least, I hope that is the issue. Admittedly, this research is a couple years old, and I am afraid the issues still exist.
