Miss Night:


>You’re worried that THAT child is detracting from your child’s learning experience. You’re worried that he takes up too much of my time and energy, and that your child won’t get his fair share. You’re worried that she is really going to hurt someone some day. You’re worried that “someone” might be your child. You’re worried that your child is going to start using aggression to get what she wants. You’re worried your child is going to fall behind academically because I might not notice that he is struggling to hold a pencil. I know.



Some powerful words here. If you are an educator, you have probably already seen this on social media somewhere, or had someone email it to you. It is really a good post.


What do we say to teachers who are worried about THAT kid taking the education away from all their other students? What do we say to teachers who are not able to deal with things how Miss Night is dealing with them? What do we tell teachers who have lost hope in their own ability to give kids what they need?
