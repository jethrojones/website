Her no-nonsense approach comes from being an educator, media producer, academic, and most of all, a mom.<br /> She is the co-founder of CyberWise, and she developed (and still teaches) <a href="http://www.cybercivics.com/">Cyber Civics</a>, the popular middle school digital literacy program currently being taught in schools in 47 US states and internationally.<br /> She’s served as Adjunct Faculty, teaching Media Psychology to graduate students.<br /> Her&nbsp;paper, <a href= "http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/jmle/vol4/iss1/8/">New Media Literacies: A Developmental Approach</a>, was published in the Journal of Media Literacy Education (JMLE).<br /> In 2019, she published “Raising Humans in a Digital World: Helping Kids Build a Healthy Relationship with Technology”</p> <p>Frank Herbert: “Once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”</p> <h2 id="links">Links</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://blog.tjcx.me/p/new-york-times-ab-testing">NY Times Headline A/B Testing</a></li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3qQByBG">“Raising Humans in a Digital World: Helping Kids Build a Healthy Relationship with Technology”</a></li> </ul> <br /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/cybertraps/Diana_Graber_Interview.mp3?dest-id=2561582">Check out this episode!</a></p>
