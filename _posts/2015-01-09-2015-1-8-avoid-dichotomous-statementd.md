Chris Wejr:


>Tom Schimmer once said to me, “Be careful of the tone of your message as it can alienate those you are trying to reach”.



I had this experience the other day, when I was trying to work with someone, and they ended up telling me, "The way you're talking sounds like I'm in trouble," when really I was just trying to coach them. It's frustrating when your intention is to have a good tone but it doesn't work. Chris is always insightful about these types of things. I'm grateful that he often makes me stop and think about what I'm doing.
