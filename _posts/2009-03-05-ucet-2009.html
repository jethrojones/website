I just finished putting the finishing touches on my <a href="http://jethrojones.com/UCET2009/">presentation page</a> for the <a href="http://www.ucet.org">UCET 2009</a> conference. <br /><br />Friday and Saturday, I will be presenting about the iPod Touch in the Language Arts 7 classroom. I hope the presentation goes over well. The plan is to let people experiment with the iPods and ask questions. I hope that it works out well and people are not bored to tears. That would stink! <br /><br />Take a look at the page and feel free to tell me what you think. <br /><br />Have a Good Life.
