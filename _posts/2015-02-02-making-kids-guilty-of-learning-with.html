<li>There is a little audio issue at about 2:15 (and at the end) from my new microphone that I used for this. I couldn&rsquo;t remove it without removing the whole piece. Please forgive me. ;)</li>

<p>Randy Barron Kennedy Center Teaching Artist. <a href="http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/partners/touringbrochure/teacher/Barron_Randy.pdf">More info here</a></p>

<li>Kennedy Center teaching artists integrate arts into the curriculum. Much more focused on students creatively solving problems.</li>
<li>Arts integration is an approach to teaching where students create an art form to solve a problem.</li>
<li>Still want to have art taught as an art form,</li>
<li>Find ways to make kids guilty of learning.</li>
<li>Find ways to show movement with content areas.</li>
<li>Science and Poetry are areas that naturally relate to movement. Math is a little more difficult, so it may not connect with skills, but it does still connect with concepts.</li>
<li>Kids solve problems. Kids make water cycle through dance.</li>
<li>First drafts are not all that they do, it is just the beginning.</li>
<li>Integrating close reading of text and other strategies to make sure students understand content, as well as dance.</li>
<li>Playing with purpose.</li>
<li>Outside of comfort zone is in their learning zone.</li>
<li>Students use drawings, demonstrations, writing, and more to show what they are doing. Each child has their own record.</li>
<li>Randy started dancing at age 19.</li>
<li>Art integration is incredibly efficient.</li>
<li>Using verbal, physical, kinesthetic modalities.</li>
<li>Movement and dance gives them more of a reason to know something, makes it easy for kids to understand and remember.</li>
<li>Uncover the content versus cover the content.</li>
<li>Interleaving (or spiraling)</li>
<li>Tip for getting started: Find a Kennedy Center partnership to get started.</li>
<li>Principals: Make sure you let your teachers have a little breathing space.</li>
