Chris Lehman, humble man that he is, won the McGraw Prize. The video that introduces him calls him a rising star. Clearly, they are late to the party! Chris has been a star for years. I am lucky to have learned from him for many years.


>Back in September, the McGraw Foundation honored me with the McGraw Prize. It was an incredibly overwhelming night – one I didn’t write about at the time, because I really had no idea how to sum up how I felt. One of the most intense parts of the evening was having the opportunity to speak about the ideas we at SLA care most about to a room full of some of the most powerful people in education today.
