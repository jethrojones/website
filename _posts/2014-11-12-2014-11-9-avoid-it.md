Tony Sinanis:


>2) Don't waste people's time just because you want to hear yourself pontificate! Be concise, specific and keep the information simple so people get exactly what they need - they don't need the whole back story or the "bird walk" you may take while presenting information. Give people what they need to know and keep it short and specific - be respectful of other people's time. As a classroom teacher, try and keep the mini-lesson at 15 minutes or less - don't go on and on and on and lecture after it is clear that you have lost your audience.Â 



Tony has been writing some great posts that are super honest and inspiring. Love learning from this guy! All his points are great. This one is difficult for me, because I tend to drone on.
