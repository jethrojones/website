<br />
As I mentioned in my post yesterday about the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-07-16-random-quote-for-email-sigs %}">Random Quote for Email Signatures&nbsp;</a>, I have a lot of quotes that I have collected from various places over the years. Many of them came from <a href="http://leadershipfreak.wordpress.com/">LeadershipFreak</a> on Twitter. And many came from sources that I can't remember now.<br />
<br />
If you would like to try it out for yourself, read the post from yesterday, and then feel free to use the TextExpander folder that I created from my list of quotes. Leave your great quotes in the comments. I'll add them to it.<br />
