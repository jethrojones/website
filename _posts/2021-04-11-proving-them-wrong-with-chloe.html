A particular moment? A certain mantra?</p> </li> <li> <p>Family, especially mom saying if you want to do it, do it, but you’ll have to be the one who does it</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Please share a story about a principal who made a big difference in your life.&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sr. year got a new principal who was very involved in what I wanted to do at school. He saw me as a student, not someone with a disability. Mr. Mark ?</p> </li> <li> <p>Videos for Disability awareness month –&gt;student of the month.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Music & Journalism are two forms of communication. I’m interested in hearing more about why you chose these paths and why we don’t see more people with your communication style in these professions?</p> <ol> <li> <p>Music - as a way to get my voice out; a way of expression that allows me to more fully express myself</p> </li> <li> <p>Journalism - as a way to connect to that love of music and be able to tell the stories of other artists</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>How have you dealt with people who don’t believe that you can do things that you want to?&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li> <p>Just proves them wrong</p> </li> <li> <p>People don’t listen, so it’s better just to show them through my actions</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Growing up with CP presents different challenges than what many of us experience.

Even if people have good intentions and they don’t start by assuming anything, unforeseen barriers often pop up. How do you handle the barriers that you are faced with?</p> <p>You have to confront and break down the barriers that exist.&nbsp;</p> <p>It doesn’t matter how fast people go, it matters that they get there.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2> <h3 id="teachfx"><a href= "http://teachfx.com/transformativeprincipal">TeachFX</a></h3> <p>Innovative school leaders across the country have started tracking online student participation using TeachFX because it’s one of the most powerful ways to improve student outcomes during COVID — especially for English Learners and students of color.
