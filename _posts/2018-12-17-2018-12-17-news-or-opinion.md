I read a news article about a church recently, and it was not an opinion piece, and while it gave facts, it only gave facts from one perspective.

I read a news article about a certain senator recently, and it was not an opinion piece, and while it gave facts, it only gave facts from one perspective.

I read a news article about a trial recently, and it was not an opinion piece, and while it gave facts, it only gave facts from one perspective.

I read a news article about

I read an opinion piece recently. It looked just like the news articles mentioned above. I'm having an increasingly hard time trusting and discerning between news and opinion.

If it is hard for me as an adult, I can't imagine how difficult it is and is going to be for our kids.
