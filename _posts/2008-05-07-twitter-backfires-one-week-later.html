I have received a lot of great comments on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-04-30-twitter-backfires %}">this post</a>, and I figured I should respond in the comments, but then the comment kept getting longer and longer, so I am just going to do a blog post.<br /><br />I understand what most of you are saying. I think what I am still struggling with is that this class really has been my worst. When they are here, I have a sick feeling. This is my fault. I have been so fed up with their attitude, passive-aggressive behavior, backtalking, and all the other things they have been doing that I just don't know what else to do with them. It was not a motivational thing. I motivated my students with negativity a lot last year, but it is not effective, for me at least.<br /><br />The real benefit to this all happening is that they have actually listened to what I have said since this incident. They are not just blowing me off. I think that we listen to each other more. This week we have been doing state testing, and I was not looking forward to dealing with them while those who finished early goofed off and weren't respectful of the other students. But they have been doing a really good job. I haven't had that sick feeling this week. I know that kids can and will be kids, and I am okay with that. It is the over-the-top aggression and disrespect that drives me nuts. I said it before, do I deserve respect from this class after calling those girls out? They certainly have not thought so.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiCjOZ6cG4aDSArp4OpB0pzID6g56D_GtOrHU-iPnjGKjJl8I50-HKR-xaEM4LpXwq0Q1WidCB9xLLEb3z7gLd_IyFnSnUFcB3b951r8jPpDEzZFp545WjzZYMyVH7-y5CpDihxIkedhT7/s1600-h/johari-window.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiCjOZ6cG4aDSArp4OpB0pzID6g56D_GtOrHU-iPnjGKjJl8I50-HKR-xaEM4LpXwq0Q1WidCB9xLLEb3z7gLd_IyFnSnUFcB3b951r8jPpDEzZFp545WjzZYMyVH7-y5CpDihxIkedhT7/s400/johari-window.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5186313615382842290" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:78%;"><div style="text-align: center;">Image Credit: <span style="font-size:78%;"><a href="http://www.roadtowellbeing.ca/expression.html">Road to Well Being</a><br /></span></div></span><br /><br />Paul, great <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-04-06-johari-window %}">link</a>! You are right on as usual. Both the students and myself had a blind spot. They were blind to how they were making me feel, and I was blind to how they felt about me. Now that something is out in the open, we can start to have a conversation about what is going on. Hopefully, it will lead to something productive. This class has been much better this week. I don't think that it is because they are trying to please me. In my opinion, they realized that I am telling other people about them, and they don't want to spoken ill of. (And that would be bad, talk about losing trust!) Either that, or they realized that I was serious, and they don't want to be "the worst" at anything. Or maybe, I just got it off my chest, so now I am not as annoyed. Who knows?<br /><br />Have a Good Life.
