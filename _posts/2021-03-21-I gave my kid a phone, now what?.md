Great news! 

As you know, Frederick Lane and I have been doing a podcast called [Cybertraps](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cybertraps-podcast/id1545800898) for the past several months. 

We hear these questions so often, 

-   "I gave my kid a phone, now how do I keep them safe?"
-   "Can I take away their phone if they make a mistake?"
-   "My child is sexting! How can I make them stop?"
-   "I'm addicted to Instagram (or any other social network, or gaming)! How do I set a better example for my kids?"

We call them family acceptable use policies.

Just the conversation required to create one will help *everyone* have a more healthy relationship with their device!

We address topics that impact kids from toddlers (little swipers) to kids just about the leave the nest (proto-adults, as we like to call them).
