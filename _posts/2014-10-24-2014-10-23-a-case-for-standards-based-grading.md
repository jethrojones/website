>Mr. Wainstein’s 136-page report, made public on Wednesday, lays much of the blame at the feet of Deborah Crowder, a secretary and then manager in the department of African and Afro-American studies, which is often called AFAM. Ms. Crowder worked with Julius E. Nyang’oro, who was then chairman of the department, to develop what the report calls a "shadow curriculum" that awarded students, many of them athletes, with high grades for classes that required no attendance and minimal work.



Or maybe it is a discussion about removing athletics from schools. Or maybe a question about why we continue to let academics take a back seat to sports in schools.
