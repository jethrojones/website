He has dedicated himself to educating as many people as possible by telling his own stories of being hacked with the hope that others can learn from his mistakes.<br /> As a lifelong technology innovator and inventor, Scott began seeking ways to help seniors seamlessly adapt to our ever-technological world, based on his and his brother Craig’s experiences with their elderly parents and the myriad of questions from a growing elderly population. In Senior Cyber, Scott and Craig pick apart a multitude of cybersecurity scams that relate directly to the financial, socioeconomic, and health & well-being of all seniors by offering simple advice for all levels of cybersecurity experience for grandparents, grandchildren, and everyone in between.<br /> In addition to his writing prowess, Scott is a highly sought-after author and expert for live security events, media appearances, and commentary on the topics of ransomware, wireless threats, drone surveillance and hacking, cybersecurity for consumers, and small business. He is often seen on ABC News, Bloomberg TV, Al Jazeera America, CBS This Morning News, CNN, Fox Business, and many more networks.</p> <ul> <li>Why are seniors and the elderly often targeted by cybercriminals and scammers, and what can they do to stay safe?</li> <li>Don’t talk down to those who are elderly.</li> <li>Phone scams.</li> <li>Many think that a person needs to be technically savvy or spend a lot of money to improve their security.</li> <li>Skimmers at a gas station.</li> <li>What are some best practices we can all take with our credit and debit cards at the gas pump or ATM?</li> <li>Family dynamics and senior independence.</li> <li>Start the conversations earlier.</li> </ul> <br /><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/cybertraps/Scott_Schober.mp3?dest-id=2561582">Check out this episode!</a></p>
