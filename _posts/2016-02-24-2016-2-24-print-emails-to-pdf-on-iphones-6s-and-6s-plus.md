[iOS Tip: Export PDFs from Print Preview with 3D Touch â€“ MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/ios/ios-tip-export-pdfs-from-print-preview-with-3d-touch/)


>A hidden option of iOS' Print feature I've recently discovered is a way to export a PDF file from the Print preview screen using 3D Touch. I haven't been able to replicate it without 3D Touch on the iPad, which makes the option available exclusively on the latest iPhones.



This means you can finally print an email to PDF on iOS. This is fantastic!
