My wife takes some pretty cool Instagram pictures. I helped her get them ready to print on 4x6 so that they turn out to be 4x4 pictures. <a href="http://paperlessprincipal.com/blog/2013/9/4/how-to-resize-instagram-photos-to-print-on-4x6-prints">Print Instagram</a> I did it using Automator, AppleScript, and Hazel.<br />
