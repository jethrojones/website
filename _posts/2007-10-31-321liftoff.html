Okay, I am pretty sure that my <a href="http://jethrojones.com/fhms">new website</a> is ready for takeoff. If you find any errors or something doesn't work, please let me know.<br /><br />In other news, I <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/from-scotland-to-stockton-learning-scratch/">read this blog post</a> a couple days ago, and I love what is going on there. The idea of having a separate learning session for your kids is such a marvelous idea. I would love to be able to do that with my kids. I would love to incorporate some of these ideas into my classroom also. For example, we are reading <span style="font-style: italic;">Freak the Mighty</span>, by Rodman Philbrick, and it would be great to host a Skype call with the author and talk about his motivation for writing the story and how he got his ideas, etc. That would be fabulous.
