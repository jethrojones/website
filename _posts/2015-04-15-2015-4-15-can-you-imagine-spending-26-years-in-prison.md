This podcast episode may be one of my favorites ever. I interviewed Michael Santos, a man who spent 26(!) years in prison!


I am fascinated by his story. He was a successful author while in prison, and now spends his time teaching others how to change their lives so they can be successful, too. It is just fascinating. We educators can learn a lot about how to help prevent his situation in the future.
