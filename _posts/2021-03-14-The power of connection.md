I’ve been on social media for years. Twitter was one of the best creations ever. 

What made it so amazing is that it felt, in the early days at least, like you got to talk with a bunch of awesome people that were your friends you just hadn’t met yet. 

Obviously, Twitter has changed, as it should. And that’s ok. I don’t begrudge it for adapting to what other people use it for. 

What I am noticing now, however is that I am enjoying connecting with people more now than I ever have before. 

I want connection more than followers. 

I want connection more than stats. 

I want connection more than hot takes and short quips. 

I want connection more than rage. 

I feel like I’m finding more here.
