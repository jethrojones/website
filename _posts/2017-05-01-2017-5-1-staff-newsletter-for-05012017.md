Hi Team,


We will have a special assembly this morning for about 10 minutes right at 8:30 to present Maddy with the results of our fundraiser. It should be no more than 10 min, and will be in the gym.


**Important end of the year stuff:**


This is our last typical tutorial cycle. We will have students with homeroom teachers the last two weeks of school. Students will be “checking out” with their homeroom teachers during this time. We will have more information about that later.


**Upcoming Calendar Events**


Happy Teacher Appreciation Week! Please see the email from Sandy about the events. Starting with a yummy breakfast this morning!


Tuesday is the Orchestra Concert at 7 pm.


We will have a Friday schedule on Thursday for the Poetry Out Loud: KMS Edition event.

Have a great week!
