>If you missed the great sharing between the educators who were able to take part in last night’s second #CE14 #CPChat of the month on the topic of Constructive Teacher Evaluation then check out the tweets below which were compiled by Joe Mazza. It was a great hour of sharing!



These chats are really great for learning how to be a better leader. Highly recommend.
