[Connected Lead Learner: "Nothing"](http://connectedleadlearner.blogspot.com/2016/03/nothing.html?m=1)


>Take a moment and think of a time in your life, that something or someone caused your mind to reach a state of rapture, which prompted you to share with everyone? As Jason Silva states “these moments are what make final cut” and create memories of a lifetime.  These moments occur in school, when students are empowered by educators to take risk outside their comfort zones, utilize design thinking and/or personalized learning, without the sense of failure, as learning is the main focus, not grades.



These moments happen in our lives and that is what we remember about our own personal educational experiences. I still haven't blogged about my #shadowastudent experience because I still don't have the words. "Nothing" is not the word I want to use to describe that experience. That is for sure.
