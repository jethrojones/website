<p>The question of what democracy requires in education is not just academic; it's fundamental to the future of our society. Arthur E. Bestor's observation in "Educational Wastelands" serves as a poignant reminder that schools must do more than just gather students; they must prepare them for active participation in a democratic society. In this reflection, I aim to explore the foundational skills students need, the importance of nurturing a love for learning over mere schooling, and the necessity for a child-centric approach in education.</p><h3>Foundational Skills for Democratic Participation</h3><p>Firstly, let's get to the basics. Reading, writing, and arithmetic are the cornerstones of education. In my blog post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jethrojones.com/blog/what-will-happen-when-parents-find-out-weve-been-lying-all-this-time">"What Will Happen When Parents Find Out We've Been Lying All This Time"</a>, I argue that we've been misleading kids about what's truly important. Without these foundational skills, the pursuit of any other form of knowledge becomes a Herculean task. These skills are not just academic necessities; they are prerequisites for any kind of participation in society, especially today.</p><h3>Fostering a Love for Learning</h3><p>Secondly, there's a stark difference between loving to learn and loving school. John Dewey, in "Democracy in Education," criticizes traditional schooling for being filled with "hand-me-downs." When the pandemic happened, we had a real chance to change how education worked, and we just went with the same old approach we've worn out like a velour sweatsuit. I discussed it in my blog post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jethrojones.com/blog/how-to-get-class-sizes-down-to-16-per-teacher-in-a-pandemic-focus-on-families">"How to Get Class Sizes Down to 16 Per Teacher in a Pandemic: Focus on Families"</a>. This approach would have enabled teachers during the pandemic to be focused on as few as 8 families, supporting kids throughout the grade-span. This approach would have fostered a love of learning in a way not seen in our institutions before. In my podcast,&nbsp;<a href="https://transformativeprincipal.transistor.fm/s6/253">Transformative Principal S6E253</a>, I discuss how when kids are engaged in making cool things happen, they achieve more than we could ever imagine. This level of engagement is not just beneficial for the individual student but is also essential for a functioning democracy, which relies on active, informed, and engaged citizens. The key is to allow children to pursue their passions. This not only nurtures a love for learning but also prepares them for democratic life by encouraging critical thinking and individual initiative.</p><h3>Child-Centric Approach and Engagement</h3><p>Thirdly, it's time we shift our focus from meeting state-imposed standards to following the child's interests. In my blog post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jethrojones.com/blog/equity-reopen">"Equity Reopen"</a>, I argue that equity is about giving students what they need, not making education uniform for everyone. When we actually design our systems around what the kids in front of us need, they and their families will be much more engaged in their educational careers and will find satisfaction and joy from that.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In summary, if we aim for a truly democratic education system, we must focus on equipping students with foundational skills like reading and writing, foster a genuine love for learning, and adopt a child-centric approach that engages students in meaningful activities. These are not just educational goals; they are democratic imperatives.</p>
