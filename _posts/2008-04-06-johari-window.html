Pete over at <a href="http://www.leadertalk.org/2008/04/leaders-and-apo.html">LeaderTalk</a> posted a good example of how important it is to be aware of what you are doing right and what you don't even know you are doing. I have experienced similar problems where people around you get upset about something and you don't realize that anything is wrong. The Johari Window explains this situation very well.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiCjOZ6cG4aDSArp4OpB0pzID6g56D_GtOrHU-iPnjGKjJl8I50-HKR-xaEM4LpXwq0Q1WidCB9xLLEb3z7gLd_IyFnSnUFcB3b951r8jPpDEzZFp545WjzZYMyVH7-y5CpDihxIkedhT7/s1600-h/johari-window.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiCjOZ6cG4aDSArp4OpB0pzID6g56D_GtOrHU-iPnjGKjJl8I50-HKR-xaEM4LpXwq0Q1WidCB9xLLEb3z7gLd_IyFnSnUFcB3b951r8jPpDEzZFp545WjzZYMyVH7-y5CpDihxIkedhT7/s400/johari-window.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5186313615382842290" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:78%;"><div style="text-align: center;">Image Credit: <span style="font-size:78%;"><a href="http://www.roadtowellbeing.ca/expression.html">Road to Well Being</a><br /></span></div><br /><span style="font-size:100%;">I think Johari's window is pretty self-explanatory. The "Not known to self" section is what needs to be uncovered. You can uncover this by surveying other people, doing self-inventories, and studying. I hope that as a leader, I will be able to uncover the things that are currently hidden from me.<br /><br />Have a Good Life.<br /></span></span>
