>Behind the theory that this company is selling is the idea that the teacher can still know everything that the students will need to learn. The time has come for that idea to die. When we lock down the internet, we send a powerful message to students that their ideas, their creativity, their interests have no place in our classrooms. Thatâ€™s the wrong message to send.



So true! My philosophy of technology in schools is essentially this:


"Don't hold people back. Let those who want to go as far forward as they want. Spend time and effort following up the rear, bringing those who are lagging behind up to the bare minimum."
