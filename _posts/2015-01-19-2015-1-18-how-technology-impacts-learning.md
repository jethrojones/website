Eric Sheninger:


>Digital tools are transforming essential elements of the education space. Understanding how they are impacting teaching and learning will help guide your consideration of which tools are useful and how to best implement them.



Speaking of presentations, I am attending a conference where Eric will be a presenter. I'm excited to meet him in person.


Eric asked what could be added to his list, and I would say that it puts learners and teachers on more the same plane than anything else ever has. I listened to a podcast the other day where a guest revealed that he was much younger than me, young enough that he could have been one of my students. I've read his blog for a while and learned a lot from him. It was fascinating to learn that he was so proficient at such a young age, in an area where I learned so much from him. He could have been my student, but was actually my teacher.
