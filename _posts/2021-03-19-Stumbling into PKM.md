I stumbled into something this week.

In my dropbox folder is a "Notes" folder that is nearly everything that I have created over the last several years.

To be honest, I'm a little surprised that it has only 1656 notes in it. It seems to me that there would be more. Maybe I lost some along the way.

I've been using Notational Velocity, Simplenote, and NVAlt for that entire time.

My first note in this folder is from a project management training I attended on March 26, 2010, just about a month after my son was born.

So, what's challenging is that these are not connected, ordered, or anything else like. There are some tags, but not a lot.

475 of the notes in there are notes from my podcast, Transformative Principal, which makes sense.

Anyway, for some reason, NVAlt wouldn't load when I got my new computer. It would freeze and would never open. I needed a replacement, so I found an app called "The Archive" from the web site [https://zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/).

Here's the stumble. Personal Knowledge Management.

Never heard of it.

I saw a post by [MacSparky a couple weeks ago](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2021/3/why-im-leaning-obsidian) called "Why I'm Leaning Obsidian."

After reading his post and watching a couple [youtube videos by Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&t=0s), I realized this is exactly what I need.

Here's my problem.

I have hundreds of notes from my podcast interviews. All saved digitally. I am in the process of writing a book, and there is so much content. I've tried using Devonthink to make it work, but that's putting things into a locked a system, and I just really despise that! I can be committed to an app, but I've lost too much data over the years, which is why I have stuck with that Notes folder in Dropbox, and why I keep coming back to it.

All my notes are where I need them, but they are disconnected and I need a way to link them. Enter Obsidian. I have to do the linking manually anyway, so this might be a good thing. 

As a side note, when I started the Cybertraps podcast with Fred Lane, he reintroduced me to [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/), which has been his PKM for years. I used workflowy, but it doesn't work very well with Markdown, and the Export function creates some gobbledy-gook with the RSS feed in my podcast, so I end up having to redo a lot of things, which is also annoying.

The other thing I don't like about Workflowy is that it creates a huge unordered list file as the backup, which is nice that it is all there, but it's pretty useless without Workflowy itself.

So, I think I might give [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a try for a bit.
