In 2009, I worked as a distance learning and media team lead. I had many responsibilities, but one of them revolved around the distance learning program for our district of 33,000 kids. 

The process of distance learning was to have a teacher in a high school teach a class, and then broadcast that class simultaneously to three other high schools. 

The teacher had a lot of training.

All the other kids were in classrooms in the other high schools.

The other classrooms had para-professionals hired to “supervise” and ensure kids were on task and appropriate. 

And, we had high tech equipment: cameras that connected to the other rooms. Poly com systems, with microphones for every 2 students, and high speed internet. 

We had a schedule that was aligned so the kids were able to see and connect with each other at the same time every day. 

And guess what, even this high-tech, specialized learning environment was not great. 

It was barely passable. But at the time, it was highly innovative, and very exciting to see what could be done. 

It still boggles my mind that teachers are being asked to do this kind of teaching with a number of kids “zooming” into their class. 

There is no way that is an effective way to teach.
