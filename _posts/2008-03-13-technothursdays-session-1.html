First of all, thanks to Pamela, Matt, Marcia, Jeff, Kara, Angela, Linda, and Pam for coming to TechnoThursdays today. I enjoyed working with each of you and I hope that you enjoyed learning some new things.<br /><br />We <a href="http://technothursdays.wikispaces.com/session1">talked about RSS</a>. I showed the Common Craft Show video "RSS in Plain English."<br /><br /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0klgLsSxGsU&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0klgLsSxGsU&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />Here are my thoughts. There were seven people there: that was a great number. Not too many, not too few.<br /><br />I love technology, and I spend a lot of time figuring out how to use it to help me be a better teacher. Of course I get frustrated when things don't work, but I understand that sometimes it doesn't go as planned. My biggest fear with doing TechnoThursdays is that people will be put off by the learning curve of new technology. It always takes a while to learn new things, and if you don't have the commitment to seeing it through to make sure that it is or is not worthwhile, it is very easy to give up.<br /><br />How can I help these teachers push through the learning curve and make it through?<br /><br />Right now, I don't know, but I have a few ideas:<br /><ul><li>I need to help them see how it is useful. They need to see that kids are achieving better because of what I am doing. This is a hard one to measure. In language arts, it is difficult to see. I need to find/create some assessments that will show that what I do helps my students.<br /></li><li>I started the session by showing them the <a href="http://technothursdays.wikispaces.com/examples">things that I have done</a> this year with technology. I went through those examples <span style="font-style: italic;">very </span>fast; I thought I might overwhelm them with everything that I have done. I didn't even get to all that I have done. If I go a bit slower, talk about one thing, and let them ask questions about it, I think they will like that better. They can go on their own time and get a brief history on the wiki. I need to be there to talk about the <span style="font-style: italic;">experience</span>.</li><li>I need to show them that it helps them. RSS brings websites to them. This will save them time, help them get new information (through sharing, which we also set up), and do other things. I helped a teacher set up student of the month nominations through Google Docs new survey form, and I really hope that it <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> make her job easier.<br /></li></ul>I hope that these three simple things work. If you have any other ideas for me, feel free to leave them in the comments.<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a Good Life.
