I don't know where I found this, but it is pretty cool. You make online jigsaw puzzles. No signup required and it is fun. Give the two below a try and let me know what you think. I think I could make a few of these and use them as some sort of learning object in my class. It would at least be a fun way to kill the last five minutes of the day on <span style="font-style: italic;">those</span> days.<br /><br /><a href="http://jigsawplanet.com/?id=aecd3eb9db98ab07&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fmrjonesed.blogspot.com" title="Fro - online jigsaw puzzle - 63 pieces"><img style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0pt;" alt="Fro - online jigsaw puzzle - 63 pieces" src="http://jigsawplanet.com/pzls/ae/aecd3eb9db98ab07.jpg" border="0" height="128" width="160" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br />If you want to try one that is really hard, try this one:<br /><div style="overflow: hidden; width: 164px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://jigsawplanet.com/?id=4e3de22038090f4c&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fmrjonesed.blogspot.com" title="AmForkTabernacle - online jigsaw puzzle - 120 pieces"><img style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0pt auto 0.3em; padding: 0pt; display: block;" alt="AmForkTabernacle - online jigsaw puzzle - 120 pieces" src="http://jigsawplanet.com/pzls/4e/4e3de22038090f4c.jpg" border="0" height="128" width="160" />AmForkTabernacle</a><br /><br /></div><br /><br />Have a Good Life.
