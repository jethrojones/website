While some people in the United States celebrate Thanksgiving today, I would like to say "Thank you" to you, for reading this.

Like you, I wonder if I ever say anything meaningful at all.

Like you, I wonder if I am a good enough person/leader/spouse/parent/child.

Like you, I feel insecure many times.

Like you, I know that I really do matter.

Thank you.
