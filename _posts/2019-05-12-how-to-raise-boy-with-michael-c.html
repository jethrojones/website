From counseling youth involved in the juvenile justice system through experiences leading treatment teams in a psychiatric hospital, all the while managing an independent clinical practice, Dr. Reichert has tested his understanding of children with practical, even life-saving, challenges.</p> <ul> <li>The stereotypes of women has changed significantly in the last 40 years.</li> <li>There’s been very little to counteract stereotypes of men and boys.</li> <li>Stereotypes shape boys’ lives early on.</li> <li>We cannot say that women are limited because of biology, but we still say that about boys.</li> <li>When Boys become “Boys” - Judy Chu</li> <li>Started out as direct, authentic and able to articulate themselves. Traveled from presence to pretense by way of posturing.</li> <li>Inauthentic and less willing to articulate their feelings.</li> <li>Conditioning comes from everywhere: teachers, parents, peers.</li> <li>A man box study - messages about being a man. Stoic, unemotional, strong, etc. Men more associated with man box stereotypes were more prone to negative behaviors, including suicidal ideation.</li> <li>Schools play a profound role in organizing the messages about what Men are.</li> <li>Every school is occupied by a hidden curriculum.</li> <li>Most educators feel as though they can’t get their arms around it.</li> <li>Boys have very little efficacy over the hidden curriculum. Policed by other boys. Often receive subtle and not-so-subtle redirection from adults and other boys.</li> <li>Student-teacher relationship and significance</li> <li>One-dimensional type of masculinity that is rewarded in school cultures.</li> <li>1500-member study of boys and 1000 of their teachers. Tell us a story about a relationship that went well and oe that didn’t go well.</li> <li>So reassuring that the mask can be taken away when they do have a relationship.</li> <li>Relationships are transformative in three ways: practically, psychologically, existentially.</li> </ul> <p><a href="http://transformativeprincipal.org/mastermind">Schedule a call with Jethro</a></p> <p>Are you feeling like you are always behind at school?
