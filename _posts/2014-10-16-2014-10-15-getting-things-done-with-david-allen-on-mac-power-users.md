I've known about and been a fan of the idea of GTD for a long time. But I have always struggled implementing it in my life. I've gone through phases and tried different things, but it hasn't ever taken. I think I am really starting to see how it could help me. This episode came at the perfect time and I am really digging listening to it as I walk to work.


My wife's GTD philosophy is "always write down something you have already completed so you feel like you have accomplished something." Not a bad idea!
