Asking questions means that you care.

When kids ask questions, it means that they are invested.

The other day we had a small grease fire, nothing serious, but a good learning opportunity. It was very contained and we slowly talked about the best thing to do and how to deal with it.

We talked about how we shouldn’t throw water on it because that could cause it to spread. Then my son asked about a hundred other questions about how to put out different kinds of fires.

“What would we do if it was grease and food?”

“What would we do if it was grease and wood?”

“What would we do if is was just wood?”

And many, many, more.

Good learning opportunities come from questions.
