March 18, 2021

Ten days ago, I mentioned this [as an aside](https://world.hey.com/jethro/8-straight-days-200-hours-of-leadership-10eb0a6c). 

But, I’m going to pursue it. 

I want to get a doctorate. I have for a long time. 

I started doing some research about getting a doctorate by virtue of the work I’ve done as a podcaster. 

I’m calling it Podcast to PhD. 

Who knows what will come of it, but I’m going to document my progress here. 

I talked with an awesome connection (I’ll ask him if I can relay his talking points publicly) and I’ve inquired at a university about options. 

Do you know anyone who would be open to having a discussion about this with me? 

Wonder if this blog will ever get tags. 

In the meantime #podcasttophd
