Resources:



[The Apollo School: What 21st Century Learning Looks Like](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/apollo-personalized-learning/): If you are interested in making your classroom more modern, read this blog post (also a podcast, if you prefer to listen). It has some great ideas in it.


[Practical Tips for Pre-Assessments](http://www.byrdseed.com/practical-tips-for-preassessments/) This article talks about giving pre-assessments and dividing your kids into small groups.


[The Rudolph Effect](https://overcast.fm/+HyiguM9qY) Essentially, we find kids deficits, and teach them what they’re missing. What if we taught them based on their strengths, and what they can do?


[CoTeaching: how to Make it Work](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/co-teaching-push-in/) We have had a fair amount of training on coteaching. This is a small refresher. Take a minute to review it and see how you’re doing with it. Remember, paraprofessionals can be coteachers, too!


[Creating a Championship Team](https://overcast.fm/+EHrCmgo/02:41) - This podcast talks about creating an amazing team. There is really good information here.


[Turn Key Thursday: A Homework Alternative](http://leadingmotivatedlearners.blogspot.com/2017/01/turn-key-thursday-hw-alternative.html) by my friend Tony Sinanis, talks about a different, interesting way to do homework.


A little bit of self-promotion: I interviewed the author of The Gift of Failure on 
[my podcast](http://www.transformativeprincipal.org/?s=jessica+lahey), and it was amazing!


Thanks,


Jethro
