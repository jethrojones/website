Jamie teaches 3rd grade at Greenwood Elementary School in Plymouth, Minnesota. She&nbsp;received her undergraduate degree in Early Childhood Education from University of Iowa. She completed her Masters in Education from Hamline University in Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Jamie and Ashley feel that learning should be meaningful and authentic for their students.</p>
<p>PICE Learning is a new and improved way of teaching comprehension skills for our 21st century learners.&nbsp;The PICE approach gives students ownership in their learning while using the common core standards. Students are able to connect with each other and independently learn in our 21st century. PICE Learning was developed by Ashley and Jamie, they wanted to connect students&rsquo;&nbsp;learning to skills that they will use everyday and in their future.&nbsp;</p>
