<ul>
<li>Teachers go above and beyond often.</li>
<li>Teachers who join us are into teaching students, not content.</li>
<li>Students thrive on feedback, and if they feel they are going to get it, they are going to go to teachers for it more often.</li>
<li>Teachers mindset has to be, I&rsquo;m going to do everything I can to help kids be successful.</li>
<li>How do you tease out that mindset?</li>
<li>If I took over your class, and I had no clue about what you were teaching, what words and phrases would your students have about you? How does the teacher see their role and connection?</li>
<li>Tell me something that went really well in the last week and why it went well.</li>
<li>Tell me something that didn&rsquo;t go well and why didn&rsquo;t it?</li>
<li>How did you choose your university? Tell me about your favorite class at university and why they were your favorite?</li>
<li>How do you connect outside the classroom and why do you do that?</li>
<li>Student discipline is not about the consequence, but it is about the opportunity to build a connection with the student after a situation and help the student see what they could have done.</li>
<li>Should be about the student growing, not about consequences.</li>
<li>Professional development focused on three areas: 1. Differentiation 2. Habits of mind 3. IB-specific training</li>
<li>Helping all faculty integrate Theory of Knowledge questions.</li>
<li>Preparing students well for assessments, but helping faculty collaborate daily.</li>
<li>Guiding principle is helping each student maximize their potential.</li>
<li>Recruited 5 people over the past month and a half who are the best.</li>
<li>Build passion and enthusiasm in their class, because it is about student learning.</li>
<li>We want every teacher to be at the top of their game every year.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re really really careful about who you hire, you can be successful.</li>
<li>Tell faculty to recommend those who are great. Only recommend top 15%.</li>
<li>We want our kids to experience a star, each and every day.</li>

<li>Don&rsquo;t measure student success on a specific score on a specific assessment. It is different for each student.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about a number, it is about them.</li>
