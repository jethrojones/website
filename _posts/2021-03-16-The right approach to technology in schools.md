Too often schools see technology as the be all and end all. It hasn’t ever been and it won’t ever be.

Kids thrive when they are engaged in something that matters to them. Too many schools tried to shove their brick and mortar system into their virtual environment.

It was the perfect opportunity to do things differently, and too many didn’t take advantage of that.

When they go back, they’re going to do what they’ve always done, so excited to be “back to normal” and that’s the wrong approach for our kids.
