Early-out days are pretty sweet. The students leave and then I can go around and talk with teachers. It is the end of the first week, and it was a really good week. I<br /><br />What have I learned from the first week of school?<br /><ul><li>Procedures, Procedures, Procedures</li><li>Be in one place to stop 95% of your problems</li><li>Procedures</li><li>Pop in to each teacher's room every day (especially the new teachers)<br /></li><li>Procedures</li></ul>I mention procedures so much because if the principal is reviewing and practicing procedures every day then perhaps the faculty will practice and review procedures every day as well.<br /><br />That is the single biggest thing you can do to keep a class well-managed. It is so hard to keep a class under control if you don't have procedures in place.<br />
