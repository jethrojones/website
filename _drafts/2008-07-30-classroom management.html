As I walk around the school, I can see which teachers have good classroom management and which don't. Those who don't have rowdy classes with discipline problems and we will be seeing them down in the office frequently. One teacher didn't follow procedure and sent a kid down to the office. It was good that we all know the procedure because it gives us an opportunity to help teach that teacher how to do it right.<br /><br />If kids are being supervised there are not many opportunities for them to good off.
