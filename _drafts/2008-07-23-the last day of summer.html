Today was the teacher's last day to work on their rooms before school starts next Monday. When it comes down to it, what really needs to be ready for the first couple days of school?<br /><br />You need to have your procedures down and ready to go. Mrs. P. put a little paper in everyone's box today that listed the procedures for how we act at school. She is going to review them on Monday over the loudspeaker.<br /><br />Classroom management is huge. Mrs. P. stresses it a lot. I am excited to see how everyone does.<br />
