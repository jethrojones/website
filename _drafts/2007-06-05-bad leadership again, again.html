Well, he did it again. Instead of coming and asking me a bunch of questions, the Assistant Principal called all students in one of my classes down to the office so he could ask them all how they were doing, what we were doing in class, and if a student really did turn off the projector while we were watching a movie! I would really love to be able to have the time to undermine a teacher's authority, BS with a bunch of students, and find out if a student that is constantly a problem really caused a problem in Mr. Jones' English class! Come on!
