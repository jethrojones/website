Today was the first day that teachers really needed to be here. Today was Mrs. P.'s first day of getting to know them all. You could tell that everyone was nervous about it, despite my best attempts to help them feel comfortable. We have a really good faculty and they seem very supportive of our new principal. They are very supportive of her, just like they have been very supportive of me. That is refreshing. I don't know if the faculty at my school would be as supportive.<br /><br />We also looked at the math test scores today, and compared how many kids passed in each class. Mrs. P. said, "You see, there are no surprises here." Those who seem like good teachers pretty much are good teachers. Those who seem like struggling teachers pretty much are struggling teachers. There were a couple teachers that did not do as good as we thought they would, but there are also some that did better than we thought.<br /><br />Test scores are where the rubber hits the road, but the only bad thing is that it is "an autopsy" and you find out how the kids are doing after it is too late. That is why we are doing interventions and enrichment at my school every week. That helps us learn how the kids are doing while they are still "sick."<br />
