The VP I mentioned earlier is really something. Today, I told him that someone sexually harassed the substitute that I had yesterday by taking a picture of her rear end and sending it to all his friends around the school. He said, "Well, you have to make sure that it really was sexual harassment..." How can that be anything besides sexual harassment?
