I realize more and more that my biggest challenge is going to be letting people solve their own problems. I talked with a teacher today, and she did ask for my advice, but I didn't let her solve it. That is not good. I don't want to be the one that solves everything. I want them to have the power and authority to do it themselves. If I don't let them, everything will pile up for me. Mrs. P. has a good habit of telling people how to solve it themselves.<br /><br />I am constantly amazed at how mrs. P. And I are so similar on our philosophy of how a school should be run an what teachers should do in their classrooms. We think a lot alike and when I have more experience I hope to me as good as she is. The better part of today was spent dealing with some misled students. By the way it is very interesting to see that the teachers that we have a problem with are the teachers of the kids that we have a problem with. This poor little form felt that she had to have a power struggle with mrs. P. Today. That was not a good idea. This girl threw a temper tantrum, screamed, threw a chair and was just a brat. She didn't care that what she was doing was horribly wrong. Now she knows, and I am sure most of the school knows, that mrs. P. Is not one to back down. She demands a well-run school, and nobody is going to keep her from that. Especially not some bratty kid who wants some attention.<br />
