I have a bad Vice Principal at my first school. Early in the year, sometime in October, I think, I sent a student down to this vice principal because she left class after asking me for permission and I refused. That was in first period. Later in the day, he brought her up to my classroom while I was teaching my students, pulled me outside so that she could yell at me and tell me that I was wrong. I was in the middle of my class and this administrator called me out of my room, leaving my students in there able to do whatever they wanted, just so that he could have a student tell me that I was wrong, and I am sure my students could hear the whole conversation. The VP did not even back me up. He just let me flounder there with this girl and then I had to finish the conversation by telling her that I was not going to discuss it anymore.<br /><br />Today, I sent this same girl down again because she called me an a-hole because I wouldn't let her turn in an assignment late. Then she stormed out of my room and came back about 10 minutes later with a note "excusing" her tardy. Then, as she threw the note on my desk, she knocked over one of my pictures. So, I wrote her up for that and again, the VP came up to my room, interrupted me, and asked me if that is what really happened. "Oh, you know what, VP? I just made that up because I wanted to make this girl pissed at me and totally mad so that she can talk with all of her friends and make them all mad at me so that they can all be brats in my class!" Of course it really happened. I don't make things up, and I shouldn't be questioned about bratty kids acting like brats.<br /><br />This is the same VP that at the beginning of the year, when the principal said "Kids lie--Don't forget it!", he was nodding his head behind her supporting her.
