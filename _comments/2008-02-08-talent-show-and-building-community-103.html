Good ideas Jethro.  Sadly in today's society no place is safe, especially schools, to not have people check in at the office.  It would be awesome to have more parents be able to help out in school and make it possible for them to do it.  Parent involvement is essential to student's success and too bad it doesn't happen enough.
