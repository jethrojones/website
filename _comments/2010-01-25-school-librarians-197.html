Okay, Jethro, let me tell you about my day today.  I got to school at 7:20 a.m.; the library had opened at 7:00, so we already had tutoring going on and about 25 students in the library.  Before school started we had more than 50 in the library—I helped a couple of students find books, helped a teacher, and worked with a student with a computer problem. <br /><br />1st and 2nd I helped 7th graders in a LA class find books and do research on WebPath Express.  When I wasn’t helping them, I was trying to compile information to make new ID cards, helping my aide get the fine notices out, and trying to finish getting ready for my Honors LA 9 presentation (which I had spent 5 hours on Saturday working on).  The Honors presentation on Primary and Secondary Sources went pretty well, so the work was worth it.  (That was 4, 5, and 6). I taught them all a new word “autodidact,” (thank you, Darren Draper) used a Google Doc for the assessment, and did a PP case study that I think they were even a little interested in. <br /><br />Oh, 3rd—the teacher’s “prep”  I spent trying to track down the financial information on a set of DVDs that had not been delivered directly to the library.  The school secretary needed the paperwork, and I had to contact 3 people in order to find out that “no one” had the paperwork, so I emailed the company for a duplicate.  I also chatted with a parent who brought her sister for a tour of the school and rearranged the scheduling of the computer lab because the Knight of the Quarter assembly reception was supposed to be in the library and hadn’t been put on the calendar.  <br /><br />During lunch I answered questions for my aide, went to the office to double-check on a reception to be held in the library on Wed. afternoon,  and talked to a teacher while eating at my desk.  7th I had 7th graders again.  After helping for half the period I went to my desk to try and prepare some media release forms, so I could take pictures to document a grant I wrote last spring.  Also talked to one of the teachers whose classes will be in the library tomorrow about the books we had pulled for her classes.  <br /><br />After school I helped the PTA yearbook volunteer get her group working on the computers on the yearbook.  Helped a history teacher find videos, talked to a World Geography teacher about an upcoming research project, and talked to the Honors 7 teacher about two upcoming projects (no, they don’t want to collaborate on Fridays; they prefer to do it after school).  In between the first 2 teachers, I made a webpage for the counselor for a 7th grade survey.  He wanted to make transparencies and make sure everyone had an overhead to show it, and I convinced him that we could do a webpage and everyone could show it on their LCD.     I was planning to go home at 3:30, but I left school at 4:15. <br /><br />PS.  I didn’t have time to send the email I had intended to send all day to the teachers/staff asking for items for the school newsletter due to go out on Friday and asking them to remind their students to read the book for our author visit next week.  <br /><br />PPS My aides changed a bulletin board, processed 2 boxes of new books, gave additional training to our new library aides, labeled a bunch of professional books, and did some regular maintenance on the school mobile lab while manning the circulation desk. They most likely did other things, but I was so busy, I wasn&#39;t really paying attention.<br /><br />PPSS Every day isn’t like this, but I’ll bet every library-media teacher (that’s my preferred title)in the district could tell you about a day that was as busy as the one I had today!
