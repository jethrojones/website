Lynda, I think that learning is very personal, but I also think that there is something to this idea about how we learn based on the generation we are from. It makes sense that you would find a great variety in the "adult population" as it possibly spans at least 40 years (18-60 year-olds). A quick <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=learning%20styles%20among%20generations" REL="nofollow">Google search</A> shows that there is support for this idea out there.<br /><br />Twitter is difficult to manage, and when I started following about 200 people, I realized that I could spend all day reading twitter. I found a neat application called <A HREF="https://destroytwitter.com/" REL="nofollow">DestroyTwitter</A> which allows you to change the preferences so that you can follow only certain people in that client. It reduces the immense amount of "stuff." Try using that and just follow a few people that you actually want to keep up with (like me, I just added you).
