Many scholars believe that sex is the most powerful emotion that humans are capable of. It can lead to love, but not so commonly. The power of sex will make men steal, kill, lie, cheat, climb mountains, save lives, change cultures, create massive fortune, win championships, you name it. Sex sells, and there is a reason.
