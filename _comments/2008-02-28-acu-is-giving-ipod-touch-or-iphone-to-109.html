Yeah, pretty dorky video.  I'm amazed that a university would accept this type of purchase.  First of all, the iPod Touch/iPhone is a brand new platform.  It's really young.  With a new technology comes a lot of cost.  You have to pay to be an early adopter, you have to pay for development time to make any custom application (because there is no existing market). And you have to pay for training on the technology (either as up-front training or tech-support).  I don't care how user-friendly the iPhone is, people won't know how to hook up their email, which is really important.<BR/><BR/>Anyway, good rant Jethro, I totally agree.
