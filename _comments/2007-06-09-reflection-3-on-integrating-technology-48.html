I just read several posts all at once.  Good reflections.  Your new goals will really help you next year.  I hope you will start listening to me brother!!  When you got your job I gave you excellent advice:<BR/> 1-Classroom management is the most important thing.  <BR/>2-Plan ahead, it is much more effective (and easier) to map out a plan of your instruction and to use the standards in your instruction. Spending the extra time to plan a lot at once will save you more time in the following days.<BR/>3-Get to know the "best" teachers in your school.  They can help with classroom management and lessons.<BR/><BR/>These were the things that helped me become a better teacher.<BR/>Although you did not take my advice, I am glad that you did learn the importance of these things in teaching.  I am sorry you had to learn it the hard way, but sometimes that is what it takes.  You will have a great year next year.  You already know what you need to do to be a more effective teacher. Each year you will get better and better.  And each year you will most likely come up with more goals to make you the best all around.  Oh by the way, I am sure that your first year of teaching was still better than other first year teachers.  Good luck next year!!!
