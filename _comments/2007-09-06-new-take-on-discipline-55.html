I'm guessing from what I have read on your blog posts...that you like this school better! Well I am glad to here that, but midvale still rocks!<BR/><BR/>P.S.- How is everything going? I am at Murray high...lets just say I live with a deaf grandma and an old lady with short term memory loss! Which I really do! LoL! It's sort of funny how that works out, is'nt it?<BR/><BR/>Email me some time. mackienze15@yahoo.com<BR/><BR/>,Mackienze
