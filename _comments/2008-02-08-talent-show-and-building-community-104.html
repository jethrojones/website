I like your idea about Ustreaming your class. Please take a look at <A HREF="http://www.parents.ourschool.ca" REL="nofollow">www.parents.ourschool.ca</A> for some ideas. I want to comment on the definition that you are using to describe parent involvement. It certainly is exciting to have parents volunteer in the classroom but there are several other ways to engage parents without them volunteering. Please wonder over to <A HREF="http://www.parents.ourschool.ca" REL="nofollow">www.parents.ourschool.ca</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ourschool.ca/NiagaraCatholic" REL="nofollow">www.ourschool.ca/NiagaraCatholic</A> for more ideas on how parents can help support their children.
