@Anonymous - I totally agree with you about _how_ those subjects should be taught. I teach English, and I try really hard to teach it in a way that they will actually enjoy using the language, like I do. I also think science should be structured with a question and tools sitting in front of the students as they come in, and they should figure out the answer to the question with the materials they have at hand. Thanks for the comment
