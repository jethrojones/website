Chris,<BR/>It is true that it is not the only player in the game. Your idea is not a bad one because people may not know what those other things are...and because of their ignorance, they will not fight the idea as much. I think if I say "iPod" then everybody gets scared, like if I say "Ustream" or "YouTube" or something like that. ;)
