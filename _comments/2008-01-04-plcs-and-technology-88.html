Darren, thanks for your support. I am glad that we connected through Twitter, and I hope I can find a way to have you help me. <BR/><BR/>Chris, thanks for your well-stated point. I agree that it is not entry level, but I feel that it is the most practical for our purposes. What do you suggest would be better? I am not against changing my mind based on better advice.
