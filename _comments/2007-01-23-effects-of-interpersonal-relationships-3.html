Jethro<br />that is a very good and interesting paper. I did find two typos however. one was one on ementoring and the five lines below you had W we. you made no mention of lack of supplies and class size in you study. sister peterson in citrus heights used to talk about this all the time. <br />As did a lot of others in Cal. Is this a purposal for a larger study? if it is I wish you luck on it I feel you have chosen a good subject. it is a problem thoughout the work forse not only schools. <br />love<br />dad
