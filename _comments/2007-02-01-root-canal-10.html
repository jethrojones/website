Dear Jethro<br />since most (all) my teaching experiece is in the the church. many times I have felt that way teaching deacons. but most of the times it has been because I did not have the holy spirit with me as i taught. When we have the spirit we can teach. dc 42:11 ITHINK. the same goes in school. some days we do not have it. but other times we do. you must have had it the day before because your worst student was prepared. count and bless those days, and try to get the spirit back. nothing like a root canal to lose the spirit.<br />love<br />dad
