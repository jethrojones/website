Hi Jethro,<BR/>Your presentation looks like it will be (or was?) very interesting. <BR/><BR/>Your "Curses!" page mentioned problems with tangled ipod cords. Have you tried zipper baggies for this? (the kind with the sliding closure--easier to use). I have had success with using them for video cables.
