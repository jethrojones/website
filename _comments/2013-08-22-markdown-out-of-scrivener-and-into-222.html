Were there specific settings you&#39;re using to get Scrivener to pay attention to the markdown formatting? I&#39;ve tried using markdown before, and wasn&#39;t able to get it to output formatted text to Word. In the end I had to hand edit the entire manuscript. At 120K words, it was officially no fun at all.
