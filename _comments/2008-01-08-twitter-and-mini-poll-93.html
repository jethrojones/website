Kelly, <BR/><BR/>Thanks for your quick response. My professor is backing someone running for the legislature this year and he said that he is running as a democrat because that is the only way he can even have a chance to talk about the issues he wants to address. It is impossible here to get past the big Republican names in certain districts. <BR/><BR/>Also, excellent point on question number 1. When I look around my school and district, that seems to be more and more apparent. I can only imagine what it would be like to see the bigger picture...
