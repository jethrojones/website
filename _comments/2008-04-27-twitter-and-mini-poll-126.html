Paul, <BR/>You are right on! I love school, and that is why I became a teacher. The difference for me is that I realize that not all my students like school. Many teachers  don't realize that everyone is not like them (English teachers especially have a hard time here). There was also a time that I didn't like school, and there were teachers that made me like school more than others. Those who have always liked school and don't realize they are different really make it hard for things to change. I often say that many students will learn in spite of what I do. That is just a fact of life. I need to find a way to challenge them, but there are some that need to learn in spite of themselves. About seven teachers at my school right now are working on a new way of doing things: we want it to be harder to fail a class than pass it. We are working on interventions that will bug a kid to death if he or she doesn't learn the material. That is the plan; I hope it works.
