Staci, thanks for your comment, and I agree, it probably will never be the same as it was before Columbine, but it is nice to dream. I just wish there were a way.<BR/><BR/>Lorna, thanks for the great resources. I will definitely be utilizing some of those great ideas when I am a principal, and hopefully I can incorporate some things now. I am trying use Ustream right now (bureaucracy is preventing that) and I will be using Skype soon, I hope. We have a wiki, but I am still struggling with getting parents to be involved. I think I am missing a major step, I need to explicitly invite them to participate.
