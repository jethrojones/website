Paul, I have a lot of those blog posts saved as drafts. I use my blog for reflection, and it makes it hard when those things that I really need to reflect on are unpostable because of the feelings of others. It is frustrating, but probably good to censor yourself at times to, as you said, protect the innocent. Those blog posts about the negative things might be the best topics to actually blog about. I think that it would be good to save those posts for a few months, years, decades and then post them.
