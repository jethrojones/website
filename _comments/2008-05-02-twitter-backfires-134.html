I like the point Sylvia made and I think it ties in with what Dean said. You became a person when they saw the public comment, and it hurt because it was public.<BR/><BR/>My own birth children often drive me CRAZY. They know this. They also know I love them. But if they saw me put a Tweet out that said they were being horrible, it would hurt because it was no longer in the family. Luckily, they're young yet and don't know about Twitter, because I do use it to vent. :)<BR/><BR/>I'm glad you brought this up. I'm conscious of what I say about my district, my teachers, my admin because I realize the public nature of my feed, but I hadn't thought about being careful about talking about the students. <BR/><BR/>I think the apology for the public nature of the post might be helpful. And maybe you can be sure to say something positive publicly, even if you're not sure they'll see it.<BR/><BR/>@digimom
