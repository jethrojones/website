Ginger, cool pic! You know, you are the fourth or fifth person to ask if I would have distance learners, so I think I probably should. I just would like someone else to be there to help with the broadcast (wink wink Darren or Kelly). I guess I could try to do it all by myself...shoot...we will try it next time, March 27th. Let's do it!
