Nice Jing video Jethro.  But, even better than the video itself, that seems like an interesting way to get kids to ask questions.  I guess I take that skill for granted as I work with adults; or I've assumed people have that skill.  As I think of it now, getting people to ask more questions is something I should probably work towards and include in my instructional design.
