Great goals and great post.  If I might suggest a book series to help you out in your application goals, it would be the "Head First" series.  Very good stuff.  Also, don't dismiss the power of attending a class.  The learning curve between HTML and full on application development is wide and steep.  This has been a goal of mine for awhile and only now can I really make basic programs work (and database connectivity is still a struggle).<BR/><BR/>Anyway, congrats on graduating and good luck!
