Steve, Boy, do I feel sheepish! Baaaaah (from Aladdin). I get it in a pop up window as well, but it does have scrollbars in FF 2.0. Well, not anymore. I disabled the "open comments in a pop-up window" option in Blogger. Hopefully, if you respond to this comment, your commenting experience will be better. ;)<BR/>Have a Good Life.
