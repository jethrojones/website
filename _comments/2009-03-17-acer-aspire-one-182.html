Just so you know, the 'processor speed' you refer to isn't the whole story.  That Dell you refer to probably has a Pentium M (like my 4-year-old HP dv1000) in it, which at 1.6 GHz is actually faster than the little Atom in the Acer.<BR/><BR/>That said, I'm typing this comment on my own Acer Aspire One, and have no complaints about the speed.<BR/><BR/>Oh, and I think you could go up to 1.5 GB of memory, but not more, as I don't think it'll take more than a 1 GB stick in its only free slot.<BR/><BR/>Take care!
