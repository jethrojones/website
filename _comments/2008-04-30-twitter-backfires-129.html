Chris, the big fallacy here is that education is a business. It is not. It is an entirely different entity. I know that there are some that think Education is a business, and they won't like this comment. You can't run a school like a business. <BR/><BR/>I <B>don't</B> think that I am doing right by telling them they are the worst. It is a horrible way to manage a classroom and it all started with calling those girls out for cheating. That was a big mistake, and I should not have done that. It undermines everything that I have been working for this year. <BR/><BR/>I wouldn't care what the waiter said, because I would just not give him a tip. You can't do that in education. We are not paid on the quality of service we provide (isn't that awful?) and so it doesn't matter how mean I (or worse teachers) am. <BR/><BR/>I have put my foot in my mouth worse than this as well. :)
