I am sorry to hear you were in the ER. Hope things are getting better. In regards to questions, you nailed it. There is such thing as the &quot;art of questioning&quot;. I love watching other people interview because I always pick up different ways of asking something that tends to result in much better information. Merry Christmas!<br />
