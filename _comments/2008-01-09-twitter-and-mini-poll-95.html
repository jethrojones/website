I'll preface my answers with stating that I am not educated at all about public education, and specifically Utah public education.  With that being said...<BR/><BR/>#1 - I think funding is a major challenge.  Schools are falling short and having to cut programs or to turn to private businesses for help.  I don't think either of those are great options.  With more funding teachers would have more competitive salaries, class sizes could be kept at a decent level, school buildings could be kept up, and most importantly, more money could be spent for enriching a child's education.<BR/><BR/>#2 - From the little I know about vouchers, I am not for them.  Having said that, the legislature member that I voted for last year (who was by far the best canidate) did not win.  If I could redo it or had the opportunity again in the future, I would probably still vote for him because the other canidates seemed so lousy.
