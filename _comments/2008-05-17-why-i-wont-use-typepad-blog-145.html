In re commenting user experience, it's a litle bit funny that when I click on the "post a comment link" on your page, I get a tiny pop-up window (in FF1.5) for the comment entry, which is too small to see the content in it, is not resizeable, and has no scrollbars!  <BR/><BR/>FWIW, most of the time when you see a CAPTCHA on TypePad, it's because the blog is specifically configured to always ask for a CAPTCHA.  For TypePad blogs that haven't been specifically set up otherwise, the CAPTCHA will only come up for comments that are suspiciously spammy.
