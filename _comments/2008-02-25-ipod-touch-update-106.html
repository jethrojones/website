Have you looked at any hardware alternatives?  There are a couple other companies that make mp3/web browsing devices that compare to the iPod Touch's functionality.  That's not to say that the iPod isn't a good choice, but it's also not the only player in the game.  Archos comes to mind; you can put the Opera mobile browser on it.  There are others that support video (not sure about internet) like creative's and Cowan.<BR/><BR/>Good luck with your proposal.
