I do not have an answer to the second question, because I am still not sure how I feel/felt about vouchers or the arguments about them.  For the first question, I think that to much of education leads to passiveness.  Whether or not the process by which the material is taught is passive or active does not matter to me except that it needs to suit individual students.  The end result is the problem.  Too many students at any level of education, go to school and take classes with no change in their ability to do good.  I think that History should be taught to develop a respect for the past and to form ideas of how to do things better.  English ought to be taught so that students will express themselves more properly than before, and that they will enjoy creativity and liberty in the spoken and written language.  Science should raise questions that the students themselves will later answer through systematic scientific methods.  I think that school should raise confidence levels such that a child can face a problem unknown to them, and then find some creative way to solve the problem.
