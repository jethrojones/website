This is always a really hard thing to see as a teacher.  I remember my first year teaching I would go home almost every night crying because of my students' personal problems.  In the end we have to remember that we should do the best we can to mold them into responsible, respectful individuals, but when it comes down to it, this is just our job.  Honestly, it's what we do to pay our bills.  That doesn't mean I still don't get upset when I see them make bad decisions, but it helps me keep things in perspective.
