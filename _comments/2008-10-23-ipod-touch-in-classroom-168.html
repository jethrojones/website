Hi Jethro, <BR/>Congrats on getting the grant for the ipods. I am very interested in this topic and have some questions for you:<BR/><BR/>1) How many students are sharing these 3 ipods?<BR/>2) What apps are loaded on the ipods?<BR/>3) How long is an ipod "session"?<BR/>4) How do you decide who uses the ipod? Is there a schedule? Is it time-based, or project-based? That is, does a slower student get more time than a quicker student?<BR/>5) Is time on the ipod used as a perk or reward?<BR/>6) What is the ideal ratio of students per ipod?<BR/>7) Does the student do work on the ipod? On a computer? On paper?<BR/>8) Do you download podcasts from the iTunes store?<BR/>9) Are the students creating their own podcasts? If so, are they audio only? video?<BR/><BR/>I know you are busy, but I hope you get a chance to  respond to at least a couple of these questions.
