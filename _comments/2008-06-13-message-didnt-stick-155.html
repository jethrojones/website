PhotoBooth? C'mon buddy, you can't be too lazy for Apple+F! ;-)  Heck, you took the time to write that blasted url out!<BR/><BR/>The only thing worse than sharing it that way is SPEAKING aloud, trying to communicate it to more than 1 other person. <BR/><BR/>Fingernails and pliers.  That's the only thing worse.  <BR/>...but she learned PhotoBooth!
