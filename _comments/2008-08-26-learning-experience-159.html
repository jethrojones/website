I seem to have to relearn certain lessons about digital text every few months. (Which begs the question, 'did I really learn anything in the first place?)<BR/><BR/>It hurts to know/realize that our words can hurt others, and that we sometimes have to 'bite our digital tongues' and not blog about whatever we want. <BR/><BR/>I want 'my' blog to be 'my personal learning space' where I do whatever the H-E-double-hockey-sticks I feel like. But the reality is that it is a public space, and in a way, I'm a public official, something I am forced think about more often after moving from teacher to VP... I'm thinking about this right now with my hock-sticks comment above:-/
