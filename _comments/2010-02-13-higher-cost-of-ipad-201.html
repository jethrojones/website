You&#39;ve spent how much on apps?<br /><br />I just downloaded the WetFish app and it lied about how much I have spent on apps. I know for a fact that I&#39;ve only spent $4.97 on apps (three total purchases) but WetFish puts me at $12.93. It doesn&#39;t know that I&#39;m a cheapskate - especially when it comes to iphone apps - and that I&#39;ve purchased several apps when they were on sale for free.<br /><br />Still, interesting ideas about the ipad. Here&#39;s to the hope that those apps can also be purchase on the cheap - &#39;cause $9.99 just idn&#39;t gonna cut it for me. :)
