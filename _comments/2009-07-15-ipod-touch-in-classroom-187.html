Hi,<br />I&#39;m starting a pilot with a K-12 district this Fall. Participating teachers (5 total) will each receive a classroom set of 28 ipods (8g ipod touch). The primary focus is language arts, but other content areas will participate as well. I&#39;ve started a wiki to help others - http://ipodclassroom.wikispaces.com
