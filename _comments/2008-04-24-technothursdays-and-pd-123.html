Hey J,<BR/><BR/>I agree with your close. My mantra this year, the fruit of fruitless evangelizing in PD workshops, is similar to what you say: "Without a need, a tool is useless."  Most teachers (and students) don't feel the <I>need</I> for this stuff. Until they do, they're not going to want to spend energy figuring it out.<BR/><BR/>Be there when they Need tech, and give them the tool? You're golden then.<BR/><BR/>(Re: your opening @Clay, I already replied on Darren's blog :) )
