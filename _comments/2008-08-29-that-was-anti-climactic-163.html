You guys are still my hero.  I remember being put down in front of an old Apple II and guided through some basic programs in 2nd grade.  Even though I have had a computer in my home my entire life, this experience changed my life and put my on a path towards technology.  I would say my life is better for it.<BR/><BR/>So, keep up the good work.  It takes time to changes minds and opinions, but you'll get there.
