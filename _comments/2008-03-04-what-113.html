That was fast Chris!<BR/><BR/>Yes, I do tweak my plans for almost all of my classes. This one is my low-reader class and they always do something a little different. And, I am required by law (IDEA, IEPs, and 504's) to change my lesson plans for every single child if need be. It can be quite a pain, but it is better for the student, so I guess I should do it. <BR/><BR/>Also, FYI, I teach the same thing six times. I have six sections of the same subject. This one is just a little bit different than the rest.
