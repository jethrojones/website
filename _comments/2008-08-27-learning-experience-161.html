Dave,<BR/><BR/>I do think that it is very difficult to navigate that fine line of "my personal learning space" and "public official." I do believe that it is worth it to walk the fine line. I think it teaches those we teach that it is good to censor yourself sometimes. I had such a good internship experience, and I wish that I could share more of it, and maybe someday I will. I did keep a journal of everything, even though I didn't publish it here. <BR/><BR/>Chris, a private Ning community is a good idea, but not right now. I do think it would be neat when I am an administrator to be able to share things with other admins and invited people that have special insight.
