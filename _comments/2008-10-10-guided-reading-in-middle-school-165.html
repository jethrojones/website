Jethro, I am going to get some of my fantastic teachers to check out your blog.  They will love watching you grow, struggle and grow more in the reading area.  Who knows they may even try some ideas they have only thought about.  You are an inspiration to the profession.  I loved how everyone clapped when you came into the media center.  What a tribute to a great administrator and friend of Columbia.  P.S.  I was in the trailer park this week, I didn't see your "friendly dog" by the mailbox.  Ha!
