Jethro, <BR/>To question #1 I would say that it that our education system in antiquated for today's needs. We are preparing students for a past time not a future time.<BR/><BR/>Question #2 I did not vote for my current legislator. The political system in Utah is so lopsided that it is making me re-evaluate my party affiliation.
