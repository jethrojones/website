I agree with the person who said they feel most proud calling themselves a librarian â€” it&#39;s certainly the title that sparks a glint in a child&#39;s eyes. <br /><br />I feel like my duties as a &quot;media aide&quot; in an elementary school are similar to those of a prep-chef, dishwasher, short-order cook AND waitress at the only lunch counter in town. <br /><br />But man, how I love to see those customers smile, especially when they respond to their teachers&#39; prompt to &quot;thank our librarian&quot; by botching my name with such beautiful enthusiasm.
