Might it help to make a distinction between them and their behavior, and you and your emotional response? I see a lot of generalizing here from both sides. Surely your students will also read this blog, and all our comments? They should. I would if I were your student. I would be looking for whether you really hate us, whether we can really get to you emotionally, and if so wonder who's out of control here, you or us? <BR/><BR/>You want them to separate whether you dislike them from your disapproval of their work (at least, from the plagiarism example, I assume that's what you're doing), but are you modelling that? *They* are not annoying, but perhaps certain behaviors or their refusal to understand class parameters are. Be specific in your criticism. Explain what you mean by "worst" in terms of standards, not emotions.<BR/><BR/>I hope I'm not sounding too harsh here.
