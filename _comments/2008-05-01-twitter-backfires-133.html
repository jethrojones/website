I really appreciate your candidness and honesty. My perspective is not so much that you called them the worst class or lost it with them but of the public nature of your comments. <BR/><BR/>As Chris, I not judging because I've been guilty of the same but while I might say a lot of things to my family that I'd never say in public and also with and to my colleagues. <BR/><BR/>To me it's understanding the public nature of the web. I still struggle with this and while not every online conversation is meant for everyone, it is open to everyone. <BR/><BR/>So my take is I might not apologize for saying it but would apologize for saying it in public. <BR/><BR/>Just my 2 cents.
