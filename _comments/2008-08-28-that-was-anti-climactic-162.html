I couldn't agree more with your assessment. I was disappointed in the way things turned out. When I was first given the information, I believed that the focus was going to be on the classroom visit, not a presentation before hand. I guess I don't get how politics works. That said, I wish I could have seen the entire lesson. The part I did see was great and am sure that what happened before had was even better. Hopefully there will be better opportunities coming up.
