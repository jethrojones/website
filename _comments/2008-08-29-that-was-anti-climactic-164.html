I wouldn't feel too bad about the experience if I were you. I think the Senator was very impressed with how well you handled your classroom and the experiences that your students were having. As much as anything, I think he just didn't want to interrupt what you were doing with your students.<BR/><BR/>I, too, wish I could have seen the whole thing. I checked out the kwl chart and I love it!  Keep up the great work, Jethro - and a nap every now and then can't be all bad.
