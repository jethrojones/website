I think the kids responded because you revealed yourself as a person and for some reason, it broke through their consciousness of you as "teacher". <BR/><BR/>Even though you may have said similar things in class, kids hear "teacher speak" in everything and tend to discount it. It's the same reason they are surprised to see you in the supermarket.
