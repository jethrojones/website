@ Doug<BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://del.icio.us" REL="nofollow">Del.icio.us</A> is a great way to get people to share information; it's easy ant the model makes sense.  With a small team I work with, we had success with Google Notebook.<BR/><BR/>Also, I'm sorry if my earlier comment seemed harsh (I'm not mean, just excited :-), but I think people forget the intimidation factor of a wiki.  Sure, we all use wikipedia, but how many of us actively posting/editing wikipedia?  <BR/><BR/>There is a very true learning curve separating the general participation and active use of a wiki.  I think there are a lot better services for small groups to use for collaboration; a lot mentioned here (del.icio.us, Google Notebook, <A HREF="http://www.zoho.com" REL="nofollow">Zoho</A>, etc.)
