What are the major challenges facing American public education right now?<BR/><BR/>Public education is in a perpetual spin cycle.  The same ideas get spun around and around without any new ideas let into the spin cycle.  Schools are run by people who liked school.  Students become teachers because they liked school, teachers become administrators because they really like school, administrators become superintendents because they love school.  School in the past has "worked" for most people, those people grow up and get on school boards to protect what has always "worked."   The major challenge is  how to get all these people who are recreating their past experiences to accept change.  We have to consider leaders for school districts that are not educators by profession.  Imagine  if some CEO took over a district and said this is the type of kid we need to graduate to be successful.  Make it happen or be fired.  An administrator can come into my building tomorrow and tell the staff about a new idea or technology and the staff has the power to reject it.  What other employees have that power to reject that which is needed for future success!!  Ahhh!  ...pork chops burning on the BBQ!! I'll leave it at that!
