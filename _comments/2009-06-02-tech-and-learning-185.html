Jethro, this is a very enjoyable post about learning styles and how you accommodate them. I liked the way you compared teaching adults vs kids. Do you really find that much difference in ages, or do you think it is more personal?<br /><br />I teach mostly adults and have found a huge variety within this population. It is true that many must go step-by-step, but there are those who love to mess around in the programs. (I am teaching the Adobe Creative Suite 4 programs-Flash, Illustrator, InDesign).<br /><br />RE Twitter--I have also learned so much from Twitter and blogs, but find Twitter more difficult to manage. Any hints on how to do this? Blogs are easy since the aggregator organizes everything for me. Oh well not to worry, because as information and the tools explode, companies come along with innovative ways to manage it.
