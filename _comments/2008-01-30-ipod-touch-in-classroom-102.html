KD, You are probably right. At our school, iPods are completely banned. The way I see it, this would be almost equivalent to getting desktops or laptops for the classrooms, only cheaper. Sure, there are other things that make that an unequal comparison, but it is still pretty close. Most of the teachers don't even understand the available software on the laptops, so most of the money on those computers is in a large part wasted. How can I get them to let me try it out and see if it there is an educational value? <BR/><BR/>That is what I want to do. If it does have educational value, it is much cheaper than computers for everyone. If it doesn't have educational value, then we blew 10K, like that has never happened. ;)
