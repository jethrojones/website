Great stuff here, Jethro, and I&#39;m not really talking about your post. <br /><br />If you hadn&#39;t written it, though, I wouldn&#39;t know Katya as well, nor would I understand some of the life experiences that have made you you.<br /><br />Life is a difficult challenge. I appreciate you and your willingness to publicly share some of the more personal things in your life. Have a good life, Jethro. You deserve it.
