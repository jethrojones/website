Dear Jethro<br />you may not want to share this, but I know that you are correct in your resoning. when I was young i never heard my dad tell me he loved me until, I was a junior in high school. I was determined to change that and to tell my kids that i loved them and to encourage them that they could do anything. sometimes that was hard to do, but most of the time i did it. I am glad you went to Andrea and Jasons and for the good effect they had on you as well as your concilar at high school. i love you. dad
