So, I'll tell you the truth.  Wikis are tough with a small community.  I put together a good size wiki at my last company (1300 pages when I left) and it was like pulling teeth.  The biggest problem is that a wiki isn't where information <I>is</I>; it's a great place for storing information, but usually the information I want to store/share is no where near the wiki.<BR/><BR/>So, if I want to add something to the wiki I have to:<BR/>1) Remember that a wiki exists<BR/>2) Get past the fear of 'is this important enough to share?'.<BR/>3) Go post the information<BR/><BR/>And, the worst part, remember to update.<BR/><BR/>The truth is, from a learning point of view, there are a lot of skills that are pre-requisite for a wiki.  For example, a wiki user needs greater understanding of a web page than your common web user.  "But!" you say, "I have a wiki with a wysiwyg editor, it's just like Word!"  That's great, but the power of a wiki isn't in the words and sentences and paragraphs.  The real power of the wiki is links, just like the web at large.  And although we all click them, you have to know that information exists and 'think' in a web page state of mind to create links.  This is usually a new skill for people that takes practice (like a motor skill; so coaching is often necessary).<BR/><BR/>So, although I commend your desire to start a wiki, it's not an entry level technology.  For example of entry level, look at what Facebook does and Digg.com.  I would love to see a 'digg-like' website for educators (maybe built with <A HREF="http://www.pligg.com" REL="nofollow">Pligg</A>?), but I haven't found one yet with a good community.<BR/><BR/>Anyway, I have a lot more thoughts on this, (if you care to discuss) but I need to go get my blog back up so I can respond properly and not in your comments.  :-)
