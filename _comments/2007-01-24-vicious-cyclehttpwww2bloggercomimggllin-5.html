Mr. Jones,<br />What a great blog. It is true that people often find themselves in a "Vicious Cycle". I only wish there were more teachers like you. You are such a valuable tool to these kids. You change and inspire the lives of hundreds. What a great blessing and challenge. Keep up the good work. There are going to be more hard times than easy times, but it will all worth it knowing that you helped to inspire these kids to become better individuals. You rock!!!!
