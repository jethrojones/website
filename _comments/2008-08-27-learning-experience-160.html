That's too bad.  I understand completely why.  I'm given access to some pretty exciting information at my work that I'd love to share, but I can't.  It would really affect our business.<BR/><BR/>Thank you for posting what you did.  I really enjoyed having this view into your internship.  I'm glad I got to read it as it came out.<BR/><BR/>Have you thought about a private Ning community (or something like it) where you could invite certain people?  That might be a fun forum for those of use that can't share openly on the web.  It might be even something I could participate more in.
