I have to pop in and tell you that I am trying to wrote a blog post about one of my lower classes.  Your experience keeps popping into my mind and I have changed the wording 100 times and still considering not posting it because of what happened to you.  Sometimes I hate blogging because I can't really write about any of my "negative" experiences involving anyone at school, or any of the "challenges" I have with students...it forces me into some kind of generic change the names, situations, and details to protect the innocent.
