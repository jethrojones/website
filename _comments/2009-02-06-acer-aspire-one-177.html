i purchased my acer aspire from the shopping channel!<BR/>it was so amazing how this small laptop stands alone and does everything your pc does. the only thing i find as a drawback is the fact that there isn't a cd/dvd drive. i would like to edit videos froom my jvc everio camcorder and in order to do so, i have to buy an external cd/dvd drive... i wish i had thought about a 30 day pre-trial, thats damn near a steal of  a price! i highly recomend this acer aspire one, its a great laptop to have!
