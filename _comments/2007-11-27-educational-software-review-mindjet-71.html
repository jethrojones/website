Man, I love MindManager 7.0.  It really comes in handy when you want to use your mind map as a project plan or if you want to turn it into a document.<BR/>At my last job, I wrote in XML, and I have really missed the power of removing content from a linear form.  So, lately, I've written the outline for a document or assignment in Mindmanager and then fleshed out the document using the Notes feature, and then published to Word, where I cleaned up the rest.<BR/><BR/>So, I would give MindManager another try.  The power it has in planning and document creation can be really helpful.
