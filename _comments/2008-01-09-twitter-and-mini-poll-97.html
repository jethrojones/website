Dad and Tiffany, <BR/><BR/>thanks for your comments. I appreciate what you said. Funding is certainly a major issue. It is hard to be a good teacher when you need to worry about getting a second job to make ends meet. In addition, I would think that most people love learning, but everyone says they hate school. That is a very interesting dichotomy. How do you get students to enjoy learning about the different subjects that they "need" to learn. I could write a whole textbook on that (not that I have the answers by the way).
