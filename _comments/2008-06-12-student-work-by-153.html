All that I did was teach the previous lesson on how to write a persuasive essay, and I let them use the PocketMod book. iPods are forbidden for the sake of uniformity. But, I did put in a request for an iPod Touch or two or three. With the App Store coming out, I think that would be just amazing, as there will be some great apps for education, I am sure. I hope that they give me the grant.
