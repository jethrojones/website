In answer to #1 I feel that we need to educate the children to love learning, and to think critically, not just parrot what the teachers say. When I went back to college a view years ago I was amazed at how the prof. would lecture and no discussion, I would challenge some of what he said, he would get very mad at me. But he soon adapted and we had a better class for it. Help them to learn how to form their own opinions, even if they are counter to everyone elses. <BR/>#2 I am not up on Utah voacher things. I do believe in voachers. I think that they will help make all schools better by compatition. the lazy teachers would be weeded out. Those who were good would be recuited by the better schools and the whole system would improve. Having worked in government for 14 years I know that secure jobs create lazy workers, myself included. When I was in the private sector I had to compete everyday.
