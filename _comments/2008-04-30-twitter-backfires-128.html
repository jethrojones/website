I've never taught in the public school, but something that I've noticed is that Teachers seem to forget that students are clients.  In the business world and the instructional design world the person you give your service to is the client--the customer; and the customer is always right, right?  ;-)<BR/><BR/>I guess it's easy to forget that the people we serve are the ones having to deal with us.  This is especially hard when students are forced to go to school.  Students <B>have</B> to be there, teachers <B>have</B> to make sure students learn; the whole thing is messed up.  It's the stupidest business model every constructed (except, maybe, for social security).<BR/><BR/>So, I know you think you're doing right by telling the class they're the 'worst', but if you think about it, would you want your waiter to tell you you're the worst table he's had that day?  On the other hand, is this a serious enough issue to apologize for?  I don't know; but I would be surprised if my son's teach said his class was the 'worst'.<BR/><BR/>And, just as a note, I've put my foot in my mouth a lot worse than this, so I'm not judging, I'm only commenting.  :-)
