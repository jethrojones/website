My thought is that lots of teachers use in class complaints regarding class behavior as an attempt to motivate them.  They're often not really the "worst class" but teachers call them that to motivate them to improve. I've had multiple worst classes in one day.<BR/><BR/>For the students to see that this wasn't a motivational ploy but really how you felt (b/c you didn't even expect them to see it) makes a difference.  <BR/><BR/>My thoughts anyway.
