# Creating

With the successful launch of my last two books, [SchoolX](https://amzn.to/34j8fOT) and [How to be a Transformative Principal](https://amzn.to/3r1MD8O), I'm writing my third book: Bad Advice for New Principals, which should be out...whenever I finish it. 

The [BE Podcast Network](https://bepodcast.network/) now has 43 shows! Wow. 

And last summer, I did a [Summer of AI Series on Transformative Principal](https://transformativeprincipal.org/summer-of-ai)

# Clarifying

This year, I've been doing a lot of speaking, webinars, podcasts, and more about AI. There's so much! It's crazy. I'm really enjoying it and I'm happy to chat with you about your needs around AI. 

If you're a school principal, I've made an invaluable resource with [AILeader.info](https://aileader.info/) where you can learn about AI tools specifically for school leaders in just 3 minutes! 

You can also check out my [Principal Turbo ChatGPT Bot](https://ruckusmakers.substack.com?utm_source=navbar&utm_medium=web&r=ac8cl) and customize ChatGPT for you and your school.
